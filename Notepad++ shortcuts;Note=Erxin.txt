I have been using Notepad++ everyday for coding at home and work for past 2-3 years. I don’t remember using any other editor during this entire period. I like this editor very much due to various features like syntax highlighting, collapse/expand functionality, ability to open 2 workspaces in same window, find in All Open Documents, find in directory, etc. It supports so many languages like PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, XML, C, C++, Java and many more. Also, it has many plugins for formatting the code, FTP directly from the editor, file browser, RegEx Helper, etc. It can be used on systems on which you do not have the admin permissions (i.e. cannot install new softwares) or even run from a flash drive without even installing on the machine.

It is due to above reasons and many more that I recommend it. All these features indeed help me in faster development, but there is another method that I use for faster development and that is Keyboard Shortcuts. I am a huge user of Keyboard shortcuts and use them not just in Notepad++ but in even other software/applications.

Here is the list of all the keyboard shortcuts as mentioned in the Notepad++ Documentation. I will mark some of the shortcuts, in bold, that I use most frequently. All the shortcuts can be changed from the Shortcut Mapper which can be opened from Settings > Shortcut Mapper Menu.
