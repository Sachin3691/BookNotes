- feedback 
- window server 2012 
    + foundation, not support hyper-v 
    + essentials, no 
    + standard
    + datacenter
- window server 2012, free and client editions
    + hyper-v server 2012 
    free but offers no local GUI and no virtualization rights
    
    + client hyper-v 
    you can enable in the windows 8 desktop os, client hyper-v is similar to virtual pc but higher performance and compatible with hyper-v in windows server 

- window server requirements
    + multiple, multi-core 64 bit cpus wiht intel vt or amd-virtual
    + 32+gb of ram 
    + local storage or NAS/san
    + MULTIPLE NICs, 1gB OR CREATEER 

- hyper-v requirements 
    + hardware-assisted virtualization 
    + hardware-enforced data execution prevention(DEP)
    + second level address translation(SLAT) is not required for windows 2012 hyper-v but is required for client hyper-v in windows 8 
    
- installing hyper-v 
    + live migration, to support live migration to make the virtual machine move from on server to another without shutdown 
    + default stores 
    + add service role
    + after install use hyper-v manager from the start menu to use it manage the virtual machine 
    
    
# understanding hyper-v

      physical networks  +-------------------+
    
- what is virtual switch 
    + connects virtual machines together
    + switches frames bases MAC address, just like a physical machine 
    + connects virtual machines to an uplink 
    + features such as 
    apr spoolfing protection 
    dhcp guard 
    port acls, access control list 
    bandwidth limiting 
    vlan identification 
    sr-IOV (new), single io virtualization allow direct access to the physical adapter 
    extensibility (new), add virtual network security features 
    
- 3 types of virtual networks 
    + external
    create a virtual switch in hyper-v and connect physical NIC and virtual NICs to let the network access outside internet 
    
    + internal, all network traffic is contain in the hyper-v host 
    + private, physical computer private, not connect to the private network 
    
- create virtual switches in hyper-v 
    + inside virtual manager | select on of the hyper-v host | on the righ hand Action panel select virtual switch manager 
    
    
    + inter proc network setting, add comment for the virtual switch 
        * external network 
        * internal network 
        * private network 
        * create virtual switches and set the network and configure the NICs, create different kinds of network for different networks
        management
        production for isolate internet adapter 
        private 
        
        * select a virtual machine in the hyper-v manager and select the setting and configure the network adapter to select the previous created virtual adapter
    + global network settings
        
- key terms 
    + virtual switch, connects VMs together and to the physical network 
    + virtual NIC, one or more virtual network interface card 
    + virtual networks, internal external, and private 


# Hyper-v extensible virtual switches 
- understanding hyper-v extensible switch 
    + 5nine virtual firewall and anti-malware, integrate with windows server 2012 
    + inmon sFlow package capture and analysis
    + cisco nexus 1000v for hyper-v
    + broadcom DoS prevention 
    
    + 5nine security manager data center will auto add into it when use hyper-v add it into it 
        * add arp rule to control firewall and apr rule to allow desktop to access the virtual network 
        

# Using virtual storage, virtual disk and snapshots
- transitional storage options 
    + local storage , DASD
    + storage area network(SAN), iSCSI, fibre channel 
    + network attached storage(NAS), NFS, SMB
    
- what is virtual storage 
    + hardware independence 
    + portability 
    + easier backup and replication 
    + cloning 
    + snapshots 
    + thin provisioning 
    
- three types of virtual disks 
    + fixed, best performance
    + dynamic, only the used space are allocated 
    + differencing, the differencing data only contain the changes relative to a parent disk for multipe os clients 
    
- understanding VHDX/VHD, recommend to use the VHDX 
upto 64tb, better protection for data corruption, improved alignment, larger block size, custom metadata, efficiency 

- new storage features 
    + USB3 storage 
    + virtual fibre channel, connect to a fibre channel SAN
    + click the snapshot from the action panel of hyper-v manager 
    apply a snapshot to switch between different snapshot 

- identifying virtual disk files on the hyper-v host 
    + check the property of a virtual machine 
    + check the IDE the hard drive will display the VHDX relative information such as hard disk name 
    + users\public\public document\hyper-v\virtual hard disks 
    + the setting of virtual machine | management | snapshot file location will display where the snapshot is saved 
    + hyper-v manager| select a virtual machine | setting|controller| add new hard drive| add new virtual hard disk 
 
 
# Using Hyper-V Storage Migration 
- storage migration, moving a running virtual machine's virtual storage to another server 
- why you need storage migration 
    + SAN/NAS maintenance
    + out of space, balance the load 
    + out of IOPS, balance the load

- storage migration, step by step 
    + requirements 
        * windows server 2012 with hyper-v on at least 2 hosts  
        * a virtual machine configured to use only virtual storage 
        
- step by step 
    + use the move wizard 
    + select what you want to move 
        * hyper-v manager 
        * action panel 
        * click the move command 
        * choose hyper-v storage migration
        * all data to same location 
        * all data to different locations
        * only virtual hard disk 
        * follow the wizard to move a machine 
    + also support move different 

    
# Hyper-V live migration
- reuqirements 
    + two windows 2012 servers with hyper-v
    + cpus from the same vendor and family
    + belong to the same AD domain 
    + VMs using virtual disks or virtual fibre channel 
        * recommended to use a private nework for migration
