- install windows server 2008 from scratch
    + repair and back option is display during the installation process
    + initial configuration tasks (ICT)
    + installation will automatcially enter tye ICT list
        * setup timezone
        * configure networking
        open the property window of networking connections
        set ipv4
        set the dns to it self if you want to add DNS role for theserver
        * naming the server
        WHERE-FUNCTION-VERSION-#
    + downloading and installing updates
    after setting up the dns server then download the updates before settle it to production environment
    + custom server
        * add active directory role
        * add directory domain services
        this will install dcpromo.exe to make the server a fully functional domain controller
    + creating active directory domain controller
        * create a new domain in a new forest
        name for the forest, such as globomantics.com
        set forest function level for the lowest level, if you uncertain, select the lowest. it's able to add function but not to remove function
        add dns server
        in the internal network there will be a warning box when create the dns server because the previous specify domain can't be reference from the parent domain server such as .com server for the global internet
        set the password for directory services restore model
    + finishing up ICT list
        * enable remote desktop
        if want to support xp remote need to enable less secure option

    na.globomantics.com for chicago and dallas
    asia.globomantics.com for tokyo
    + upgrade 2003 to 2008
- install the active directory domain services role
- upgrade from windows server 2003


# Simplifying Installation with Windows Deployment Services
- Window deploy services, WDS
- Getting reading to WDS
    + what is WDS
    it's is a role has been included with window server 2008 for remotely deploy server 2008 and vista
    + WDS requirements
    active directory, dns, dhcp, an ntfs partition for the storage of images on the WDS server the images may use a quite of space
- install the WDS role
    + make client install from network
    + make every other server install in the office and ship them after installation
    + install dhcp 
        * start server manager
        * add role, DHCP and follow the wizard, don't need the winsserver
        winsserver is microsoft's implementation of NetBIOS Name Service(NBNS), a name server and service for NetBIOS computer names
        * add ip address scope 
        NY Clients
        starting ip address 192.168.10.101
        ending ip address 192.168.10.120
        sub mask 255.255.255.0
        default gate way 192.168.10.200 which is the previous installed NY server (current machine)
        enable ipv6
        put ::1 as ip configuration 
        use current credentials
    + if you have more than on hard drive, should specify partition to disk
    + install Windows Deployment Services role
    choose which specific service to install
        * deployment server
        * transport server which is subset of deployment server
    install all server
- Configuring WDS
    + open administrator tools
    + open window deployment services tool
    + by default the local server is added, or right click to add more server 
    + right click current server select configure server
    pick the location for the images which will be deploy to the client machine
    
    check not listen on port 67 if current computer is also DHCP server, and configure DHCP option 60 to 'PXEClient'
    
    PXE Server initial setting, set respond only to known client computers, you have to know the client GUI 
    
    add image for the WDS, navigate to the folder of a window DVD
    image file such as boot.wim, install.wim, ...
    
    create a new image group to manage different operation system such as 'server 2k8'
- WDS Properties, window deployment services tool
    + select the server property, several tabs
        * general, 
        * PEX Response settings, 
        * directory services, set the new client naming policy
        * client simply the window automate deploy process use the unattend installation
        * DHCP choose or setting works with dhcp role
        * network setting, multicast ip address
        * advanced
    + setting up multicast transmission, without it may be the max client number is less than 10
    + expand the server node
    select multicast transmission and right click to create
    
    called deploy 2 servers
    
    select the images which to use
    
    scheduled-cast and set threshold select start automatically when the number of clients ready to receive this image
    
    switch to the client pc and boot from network(press f12)
    
    input the credential user name domain\user or user@domain.com and password, for example
    globomantics\administrator and password
    
- installing automated installation kit(AIK)
select the server image to set the image enable unattend install and specify the answer file

the answer file is format with xml, down the answer file or use the automated installation kit to create the answer file

# deploying read only domain controllers
- what are the benefits of using an RODC (read only domain controller)
    + by default RODC's do not maintain password
    + not changes can be made to the AD database on the RODC
    + RODC's have local a administrator group which allows users in the branch office to administrate the computer without having privileges to the domain
    the local administrator will not gain permission to change the real AD server
- installing an RODC in a branch office
    + Globomantics Network
    new york, chicago, dallas, tokyo
    + install steps
        * remote to the dallas server
        * open server manager and add roles
        * add active directory service role
        * after the wizard and click the link launch the Active Directory Domain services installation wizard(dcpromo.exe)
        * select existing forest, add a domain controller to an existing domain
        * keep the forest name
        * pick na.globomantics.com domain 
        * keep the default site
        * select options
        DNS Server, use to let user get dns mapping from the server
        Global catalog server, is use to let user authotication from the server for active director
        RODC server
        * pick group or user (option)
- Testing Replication Between a DC and RODC
    + the Active Directory User and Computers manage tool is always use the current user to link to writeable domain controller
    + switch to the RODC server by switch the domain controller
    + create a domain user group by the writeable domain controller 
    + create a administrator for the dallas RODC
- configuring a password replication policy
    + the writeable domain controller user node have a Allowed RODC Password Replication Group Properties, add the users which need the RODC replication the user's password
    + click the Domain Controller node and click the specific RODC domain controller and open the property 
    select the Password Replication tab. 
    Click add and need user group to allow password replication
- Administrator Role Seperation for RODC
    + open server manager
    + open configuration node
    the normal domain controller will not contain user manage
    + open command prompt
    type in
    $ dsmgmt
    which will open ds management utility

# Virtualization
- what is virtualization
    + having one physical computer act as though it is multiple computers
    + virtualization allows multiple instances of either the same or different operating systems to rn on a single computer
- benefit of virtualization  
- virualization Products
    + Hyper-V, is a role which is built in to the 64-bit version of windows server 2008
    + Virtual Server which will be the replace for Hyper-V
    + Virtual PC, to works with client
    + VMWare Server
    + VMWare Workstation
- Virtualization Examples
    + amazone server
- Hyper V require
    + an x64 processor
    + hardware-assisted virtualization
    + hardware data execution protection
    
    
# Using Group Policy to Simplify network administration
- virtual hard disks(VHDs)
    + VHDs provide storage for a virtual machine
    + VHDs can be IDE or SCSI
    + VHDs can be dynamically expanding or a fixed size
- differencing disks
    + differencing virtual hard disks are assocaited with another VHD in a parent-child relationship
    + changes made to the child are kept separate from the parent but can be merged
    + differencing disks can only be dynamic
    + typically used when standard base image are needed
- pass-through disks
    + pass strait physical hard disk to virtual machine
    + typically used with 
    SANs, NAS, iSCSI
    + no size limitations
    + no support for dynamically expanding VHDs, differencing disks or snapshots
- creating virtual machines
    + creating VHDs
    open hyper-v manager
    new virtual machine or new hard disk
    + create virtual hard disk
    + choose disk type
        * fixed size
        * dynamically expanding, maximum is 2tb
        * differencing, use another virtual disk as parent 
    + follow the wizard
    
    + create virtual machine
    + check system info
    msinfo32
    + configure memory
    + configure connection, external access, choose virtual network
    + configure virtual hard disk or use existing virtual hard disk, or attach later
    + install a os
- virtual machine setting
    + add hardware, or add more hardware
    + bios
    + edit hard drive
        * change to fix size
        * expand size
        * compact empty space
    + dvd drive
    + SCSI controller
    + network adapter, use v LAN identification by change the network adapter
    + COM1,2
    + virtual machine name
    + integration services
    services to offer to the virtual machine
        * operating system shutdown
        * time synchronization
        * data exchange
        * heard beat
        * backup(volume snapshot)
    + automatic start action, when power loss or restart the server
    + automatic stop action when power loss, this need to install the integration services
- installing windows server 2008 r2 on a virtual machine
    + start the machine
    + connect to the virtual machine
    + change the computer name as the hyper v setting
    + enable remote desktop
- installing integration services
    + use the virtual connected window, select the Action menu, select insert "integration services setup disk"
    + then the integration service disk in inserte in the CD of the virtual machine
    + the setup wizard is open
- migrating legacy virtual machine
    + copy VHD to hyper-v
    * create a new virtual machine with the VH
    + start the new virtual machin and instal integration services
- snapshots
    + freeze a point in time
    + can be reverted back to at any time
    + typically better for testing environment
    + create a snapshot
        * stop the machine
        * click the snapshot button at the right corner of the panel
        * apply a snapshot to undo everything after the snapshot
