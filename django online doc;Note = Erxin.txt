# introduction, django 1.5.1
- build a web project
django-admin.py startproject mysite
- web proejct structure
mysite/
    manage.py
    mysite/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
	* The outer mysite/ directory is just a container for your project. Its name doesn’t matter to Django; you can rename it to anything you like.
	* manage.py: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways. You can read all the details about manage.py in django-admin.py and manage.py.
	* The inner mysite/ directory is the actual Python package for your project. Its name is the Python package name you’ll need to use to import anything inside it (e.g. import mysite.settings).
	* mysite/__init__.py: An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package. (Read more about packages in the official Python docs if you’re a Python beginner.)
	* mysite/settings.py: Settings/configuration for this Django project. Django settings will tell you all about how settings work.
	* mysite/urls.py: The URL declarations for this Django project; a “table of contents” of your Django-powered site. You can read more about URLs in URL dispatcher.
	* mysite/wsgi.py: An entry-point for WSGI-compatible webservers to serve your project. See How to deploy with WSGI for more details.
- start the light weight development web server
python manage.py runserver [ip]:[8080]
- database setup
	* ENGINE – Either  'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2', 
                                   django.db.backends.mysql', 
                                   'django.db.backends.sqlite3' or 
                                   'django.db.backends.oracle'. 
                                   Other backends are also available.
	* NAME – The name of your database. If you’re using SQLite, the database will be a file on your computer; in that case, NAME should be the full absolute path, including filename, of that file. If the file doesn’t exist, it will automatically be created when you synchronize the database for the first time (see below).
    When specifying the path, always use forward slashes, even on Windows (e.g. C:/homes/user/mysite/sqlite3.db).
	* USER – Your database username (not used for SQLite).
	* PASSWORD – Your database password (not used for SQLite).
	* HOST – The host your database is on. Leave this as an empty string (or possibly 127.0.0.1) if your database server is on the same physical machine (not used for SQLite). See HOST for details.
    * set TIME_ZONE to your time zone. The default value is the Central time zone in the U.S. (Chicago).
- run the development server
python manage.py runserver
the server is running at  http://127.0.0.1:8000/
set the server ip and port
python manage.py runserver [ip:][port]
update the codes don't need to restart the development server but adding files or compiling translation files don’t trigger a restart, so you’ll have to restart the server in these cases.
- change the timezone to Asia/Shanghai PRC, the avaliable timezone list is 
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/static/datetime-keywords.html#DATETIME-TIMEZONE-SET-TABLE
