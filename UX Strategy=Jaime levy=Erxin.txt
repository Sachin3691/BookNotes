# What is UX Strategy
- Experience strategy, sidebar from the book mental models rosenfeld media

The strategy that you develop for your product ought not evelve in isolation. event though the value of user experience is clear you over-arching reasons for providing something should be considered with equal weight. jesse james garrett describes the pharse experience strategy thusly 

experience strategy = business strategy + UX strategy 

a mental model helps you visualize how your business strategy looks compared to the existing user experience. Thus it is a diagram that can support your experience strategy 


# The four tents of UX Strategy 
- if you are doing best practices, you are not innovating 
- the following ways are 
    + they work collabortively with stakeholders and teammates at the idea's inception. then ux designer can be involved in designing structured experiments 
    
    + they help determine the key moments and features that are absolutely critical to your product 
    + they learn everything about the existing market space to identify ux opportunities that can be exploieted 
    + they talk directly to potential users or existing power users of the product to discover and validate its primary utility with respect to the problem that must be solved 
    + they weave the UX through all touch points online and offline enabling an experience that is frictionless.

# Validation the value proposition 
- the customer is a group or segment of people with a common need or pain 
- if you don't want to live on fantasy island 
    + define your primary customer segement 
    + identify your customer segement's problem 
    + create provisional personas based on your assumptions 
    + conduct customer discovery to validate or invalidate your solution's intial value proposition 
    
    
# Conduction competive research 
- is the competitor's brand also on twitter, facebook, or others? which social platforms is it truly using? most products these days integrate with these platforms, but they don't fully leverage anything with all of them 

- the purpose of the site is why it exists; it's basically the high-level description of the product or the value propsition 

- competitive analysis matrix template 
direct competitor       
    + UML of websites or app store location       
    + user names and password access      
    + purpose of site 
    
indirect competitor 
    ...

- lessons learned before you start a new business, learn everything you can about how it works. don't let your enthusiasm dull your logic. investigate your competition. what are they doing right now? what are they doing wrong? why should customer come to you? and when you can't figure out how to make it work, admit defeat. it's totally okay to fail! but move on. or pivot!


# Conducting competitive analysis 
- look for clues in these areas: revenue streams for monetizationMental model for the navigation system or transaction flowFeatures that simplify the experienceNew and interesting visual treatments and animationsImproved messaging and content strategy 
- the four steps to a competitive analysis opportunities, follow these four steps 
    + scan, skim and color-code each column for highs and lows 
    + creating logical grouping for comparison 
    + analyze each competitor by benchmarking product attributes and best practices(this goes in the last column of the spreadsheet)
    + writing the competitve analysys findings brief 
    
    
# Innovation 
- here are the points that i want to make, all these products have complete distinct user experiences and business models. They all have had undeniable success competing in the same customer pool 

- storyboards are not necessarily deliverables. there are cases for storyboards in other work environments where they are super helpful to pitch ideas, but for now, we just are using them to map out the key experience in a narrative context 

- seeing the common user flows throught the apps so that i could quickly make an application or site map. 

recognizing the patterns and common ways for helping users accomplish their goal. in other words, if i wanted to lure customers over from another application to my own. i could determine user expectations in advance. 

avoiding creating something totally new and making the UI more complicated because i now knew what my competition was already doing well. 

dealing with insane stakeholders or a HIPPO(highest paid person's option) who, based on no empirical evidence, though that he know the best way to do my job. 

- compare different products visually side-by-side. based on these comparisons i took notes when ideas occurred to me 

- what is an example of the most important thing the customer can do with your product that they can't do with other competitors?

what is the pain point that you are trying to solve that is not currently being solved by competitors? how would your solution be presented to the customers on a screen? it is an interactive interface or displayed result? 

express the benift that users will see finally, waht would customers do next after they saw this screen? 

would they realize the value propsition? again they saw this screen? would they realize the value of proposition? again express the benefit as a scenario that the user will see 

- get your idea jucies flowing on the key expreience ask yourself these questions 
    + what will maek your provisional personas(hypothesized customers) love this product? 
    + waht moment or part of the user's journey makes this product unique
    
    based on your competitive reseearch and analysis what scenario or feature resolves a big shortfall?
    
    + waht kinds of workarounds are your potential customer currently doing to accomplish their goals?
    
- the four techniques you are about to learn are how to identify the key expreiences 

take advantage of UX influencers do feature comparision. Storyboard the value innovations be aware that these techniques are more for your personal or your team's edification 

- there are many aspects to building successfuly digital products inventing them is just one small part of the fun. you also need sustainable adoption, scalability wide distribution, revenue streams, and a tream bigger than yourself basically you need an innovative business model 

- context is key. my own floppy disk magazines were compelling not just because of the new technology the content on them which featured anti-silicon valley rants and tips on sneaking into expensive tech tradeshows, was actually a symbiotic part oft he value innovation 

- lessons learned timming is everything even if you are fist to market with a disruptive innovation, there are no guarantees of success 

- cool tools for interactive prototypes, if you decide to go that route

# Creating prototypes for experiments 
- the order and amount of the middle screens is flexible based on how many key experiences you need to show. 

steup typically the landing page or user dashboard. key ux1 typically in one to three screens shows the crucial interactions that show value innovation 

key ux 2. typically in one to three screens shows the crucial interactions that shwo value innocation value proposition this is the final result of successfuly transaction. pricing strategy. this shows the cost of the app. monthly fees, pacakge costs and so on
