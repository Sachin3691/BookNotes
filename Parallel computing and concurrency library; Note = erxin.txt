Parallel computing and concurrency library; Note = erxin

:Category, concurrent programming libraries
A
    - Accelerator (library), Accelerator is a data parallel library being developed by Microsoft Research. It allows data parallel programs to be written that runs on the GPU. It utilizes the DirectX runtime and shader programs to communicate with the GPU. 
    - Algorithmic skeleton, In computing, algorithmic skeletons (a.k.a. Parallelism Patterns) are a high-level parallel programming model for parallel and distributed computing.
C
    - Celery Task Queue, Celery is an open source asynchronous task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing. It is focused on real-time operation, but supports scheduling as well.
    - Concurrency and Coordination Runtime, Concurrency and Coordination Runtime (CCR) is an asynchronous programming library based on .NET Framework from Microsoft distributed with Microsoft Robotics Developer Studio (MRDS).
D
    - Dryad (programming), Dryad is an ongoing research project at Microsoft Research for a general purpose runtime for execution of data parallel applications. An application written for Dryad is modeled as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The DAG defines the dataflow of the application, and the vertices of the graph defines the operations that are to be performed on the data.
G
    - Global Arrays, is the library developed by scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory for parallel computing. GA provides a friendly API for shared-memory programming on distributed-memory computers for multidimensional arrays.
I
    - Intel Array Building Blocks, Intel Array Building Blocks (also known as ArBB) is a C++ library developed by Intel Corporation for exploiting data parallel portions of programs to take advantage of multi-core processors, graphics processing units and Intel Many Integrated Core Architecture processors. 
I cont.
    - Intel Threading Building Blocks, Intel Threading Building Blocks (also known as TBB) is a C++ template library developed by Intel Corporation for writing software programs that take advantage of multi-core processors. 
J
    - Joins (concurrency library), The research language C¦Ø promised C# users a more pleasant world of concurrent programming. C¦Ø presents a simple, declarative and powerful model of concurrency - join patterns - applicable both to multithreaded applications and to the orchestration of asynchronous, event-based distributed applications.
K
    Kombu Messaging Framework, Kombu is a software package to enable messaging in Python by providing an idiomatic high-level interface for the AMQ (Advanced Message Queuing) protocol.[1]
M
    - Monte Carlo Machine Learning Library, The Monte Carlo Machine Learning Library (MCMLL) is an open source C++ template library which already relies on some C++0x specs. MCMLL is licensed under the GNU GPL. It is developed under the 64 bit Linux OS. 
    - MPICH, MPICH is a freely available, portable implementation of MPI(Message Passing Interface), a standard for message-passing for distributed-memory applications used in parallel computing. MPICH is Free Software[1] and is available for most flavours of Unix (including Linux and Mac OS X) and Microsoft Windows.
N
    - Ntropy, NTropy is a computer library under development at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and the University of Pittsburgh Department of Physics and Astronomy that enables the rapid development of any algorithms that uses a kd-tree for running on a parallel computer. 
O
    - ?MQ, also spelled ZeroMQ, 0MQ or ZMQ) is a high-performance asynchronous messaging library aimed at use in scalable distributed or concurrent applications. 
O cont.
    - Open MPI, Open MPI is a Message Passing Interface (MPI) library project combining technologies and resources from several other projects 
P
    Parallel Extensions
    - Parallel Patterns Library, The Parallel Patterns Library (PPL) provides an imperative programming model that promotes scalability and ease-of-use for developing concurrent applications. 
S
    - SAGA C++ Reference Implementation, The SAGA C++ Reference Implementation is a set of free cross-platform libraries written in C++ and Python which provide a set of high-level application programming interfaces (API) and runtime components that allow the development of distributed computing and grid computing applications, frameworks and tools. SAGA is the first complete implementation of the Open Grid Forum Simple API for Grid Applications 
    - SnakeMQ, SnakeMQ is a small cross-platform Python library for easy and reliable communication between hosts.
    - Stapl,Stapl (Standard Adaptive Parallel Library) is a library for C++, similar and compatible to STL. It provides parallelism support for writing applications for systems with shared or distributed memory.
T
    - Trilinos, Trilinos is a collection of open source software libraries, called packages, intended to be used as building blocks for the development of scientific applications. The word Trilinos is Greek and embodies the concept for "a string of pearls."
