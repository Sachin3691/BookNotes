>object module. The categories are as follows:
	- PeString Titles, Labels, and other string type properties. 
	- PeData Includes properties defining the quantity, attributes, and data-access related features. 
	- PeLegend Includes properties related to legend, colors, line types, points types, location. 
	- PeFont Includes all font related properties. 
	- PeColor Includes all color related properties. 
	- PePlot Another large nested property including other nested properties to control plotting method access and plotting options. Generally includes everything related to how data is rendered into graphics. 
	- PeGrid A large nested property including other nested properties to control grid options and grid configuration. Grid configurations deal with quantity and frequency of grid lines. Grid options deal with how grid lines are optionally rendered. 
	- PeAnnotation Includes other nested properties dealing with graph, line, axis, and table annotations. 
	- PeConfigure Includes properties controlling visual or functional features global in nature. 
	- PeUserInterface Includes other nested properties related to menus, dialogs, scrollbars, cursors, and availability of user interface features. 
	- PeSpecial Includes rarely used features. 
	- PeTable Unique to the Graph object, includes table related times. 
	- PeFunction Includes all methods to initialize, reset, export and perform other tasks. 
>installation
	- choose toolbox items, use the context menu add/remove items
	- select the Gigasoft.ProEssentials.dll or Gigasoft.ProEssentialsWeb.dll
>deployment
	- ProEssentials v6 Pro, Gigasoft.ProEssentials.Dll and PEGRP32D.DLL
	- ProEssentials v6 Pro, Gigasoft.ProEssentialsWeb.Dll and PEGRP32D.DLL
>for .net, create c# demo project
	- create winform application
	- add toolbox item for proEssentials, find the "gigasoft.ProEssentials.dll"
	- proEssential use the terms subset and points
>asp.net project
	-RenderingType This property controls how this instance of the control is rendered into HTML.
	Possible settings are: 
		* ImageMap, the control is rendered as an image tag followed by an ImageMap tag.
		* ActiveX, the control is rendered as an ActiveX object tag.
		* BinaryImageStream, render as binary data representing image data.
		* ActiveXImageStream, render as binary data representing an ActiveX binary state.
		* BinaryDataStream, use with client side ActiveX LoadFromUrl method to update chart without refreshing page containing the chart. 
>control the property array
	- .clear() method
	- .reset() method will empty the property settings and revert the object to its default state
	
:Pass data
>common indexers of property arrays
