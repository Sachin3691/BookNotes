Amozen Web Services AWS developer fundamentals; Note = Erxin

## What exactly is AWS?
- is set of IT infrastructure	 services
- infrastructure-as-a-service(IaaS), infrastructure is a service as compute network storage things like that
- plateform as a servie (PaaS)
- problems that can be solved
	* hosting web app
	* running legacy applications
	* massive high performance computing batch jobs
	* digital asset management
	* backup and storage of system data
	* data sharing
	* any where to access computing environment
- key principle
	* global regions / availability zones
	* webservices access strategies, REST/SOAP/Query
	* machine hour
	* free tiers
	* high reliability
	* eventual consistency
	* access credentials
	account id, access key id, secret access key
	certificates
	key pairs
- product categories
	* compute servies, on-demand virtual machines
	* storage services
	* database services
	* networking services, for dns, vpn...
	* message delivery servies
	* content delivery serviecs, provide edge locations for frequently accessed content
	* deployment and management services, security monitor
- developer role in AWS solutions
	* host development environment
	* deploy web app
	* storage services
	* cloud database
	* secure app
	* create message layer
- interact with AWS
	* soap/rest/query
	* sdks
	* command line(java)

## Using the AWS management console
- the mangement console is the home page of AWS
- role of IAM in securing AWS resources, identity and access management
	* user start with restrict and need asign right to use services
	* there is to kinds of authority method, user and group, group couldn't be nested, user could be added into any group to at all the right of that group have
	* all these method could do via amazon api
- AWS service expect upper letters timestamp encoding, some of the url encode library will just give lower letters such as .net
	* have a specific format
	* is send string with url 
	* is not rest and not soap
	* ex. create request string to call create user
	string stringToConvert = "Get\n"+
	"iam.amazonaws.com\n"+
	"/\n"
	"AWSAccessKeyId=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"+
	"&Action=CreateUser" +
	"&Path=%2F..." +
	"&SignatureMethod=HamcSHA1" +
	"&SignatureVersion=2" +
	"&Timestamp" + timestamp + 
	"&UserName=SOME_USER_NAME" +
	"&Version=2010-05-08"
	Encoding ae = new UTF8Encoding();
	HMACSHA1 Signature = new HMASHA1();
	ae.GetBytes(YOUR_AWS_PRIVATE_KEY_STRING);
