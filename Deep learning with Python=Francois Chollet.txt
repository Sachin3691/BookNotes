AI pioneer Alan Turing as “Lady Lovelace’s objection” in his landmark 1950 paper “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,”

- machine learning compare to traditional program 

rules -> | classical   | -> answers 
data ->  | programming |

data    -> | machine     | -> Rules
answers -> | learning    |

Unlike statistics, machine learning tends to deal with large, complex datasets (such as a dataset of millions of images, each consisting of tens of thousands of pixels) for which classical statistical analysis such as Bayesian analysis would be impractical

- Machine-learning algorithms aren’t usually creative in finding these transformations; they’re merely searching through a predefined set of operations, called a hypothesis space.

- learning means finding a set of values for the weights of all layers in a network, such that the network will correctly map example inputs to their associated targets
