:Reference documents
master checklist document, W:\J\WinNT\PCProduction\Shortcut to Jobs folder
machine folder, w:\mc


:Pc production user guide
>Overview and background
>actual location of the machine folder is w:\mc
    it contains all files that need to be configured for that machine and all necessary production system files

:Create a new machine
>click button "Create a new machine"
>select desired product line
    -production line: Hylectric, Hypet, ISB, QuadLoc, Thixo, Robot, Index, Other use chart
    -standard developer machine, select the desired product line and revision
    -sepcial ctstd machine creation, select other use chart and fill in the target ctstd and the production line
>fill in checklist
    the master checklist document, W:\J\WinNT\PCProduction\Shortcut to Jobs folder
>search for a existing machine
    -default search by serial number
    -other search keyword, OICOMMON_Pointer, Origin, PriEng, ProductLine, Release, SerialNum, Status, TestNot...
>Open machine details
    table headers, serial number, job number, genfac, machine type, release
>Production commands
    reference the checklist section
>Compile machine
    converting the information in the checklist into a module listing(i.e. SYSTEM.OID) and a keyword listing(i.e. KEYWORDS.BAS)
>TroubleShooting, compile machine
    -permission denied, not all files can be modify, select all folder try again.
    -unhandled exception in SYSOIT.EXE, unhandle pointer reference in one of the C source files. 
        -Click don't send
        -open the machine's debug project in VC
        -on the debug toolbar click "go"
        -identify the source of the error, such as a char* reference before initialized, null reference
        -communicate the error to the designer who is responsible to the chart
        -follow up to make sure the error has been resolved.
    -module "has not been properly processed" error
        -a module number for the chart was selected, but it was not ouput to the SYSTEM.OIT file
            -this is a new type of module, can't be reference function "create_system_oit" in CTSTD.C
            -refernece this at "Charts user and design guide.doc"
            -the name specified in MODULE_INFO_T table in a special (CTSP*) or deviation (CTDV*) chart does not exactly match that specified in the standard chart.
    -How to debug a module charts problems
        -SYSOIT.EXE has encountered a problem and needs to close
            -verify the same problem come from PCProductionUtility
            -click don't send
            -Open VC6DEBUGsearial_number.DSP project from the machine's Temp folder using VS6 or open vs higher version VS
            -Build the program in Debug mode
            -Then get the eventually problems
            -check the stack
            -open the module by CodeWright from PCProduction Utility
            -open the module's c file
            -view the history and compare diff

:Generate machine
open machine detail and select the production tab, click "Generate machine" button
>menu list
    -GenerateMachine (for generating complete machine)
    -GenerateElectricalSchematics (for generating electrical schematics only)
    -GenerateMachineWithoutWSM (for generating machine without WSM)
    -UpdateMachine (update changes to previously generated machines)
>in the MTU generate machine- instruction list window, select "Suppress warnings", ok and start transfer
>Check the generate error, after MTU finished
    -click "View system files" button
    -select "Config.Eorrors" tab and type "err" in the "Filter" field
>TroubleShooting
    -build of vbTesterNote<sn>.dll failed
        occurs at the end of "compile machine" and as an independent process
        solve:
            press "generate tester notes"
            look at config.errors
            open vbTesterNote<sn>debug.vbp in the machine temp directory
            use the tools in vb6 to debug the project

:View system files
This window open an error sumamry. Overwrite on each generation. The prefile changed name to _previous
>Compile errors, type "err" in the filter field
Exit the system files window if there are no errors, otherwise fix the errors and recompile the machine
>Include error files
    -config.errors, generate during the generate process, logged in the file "ParameterCharts.err"
    -update.errors, generate during the generate process and log in the file, "Update.log"
    -datalog.errors, generate during the compile and generate process are logged in the file "VBDatalog.err"
    -testernote.errors, generate during the compile and generate process are logged in the file "VBTesterNote.err"
>Rev.log, contains a machine history of changes
>system.oit, contains the module listing
>system.log, the log file of all production activity for this machine
>screen where notes can be previewed that will be sent for tester to read. Aslo enables the designer to enter notes specific to this machine in the "Designer Notes to Tester" box
>module mappings, show the module mapping generate by the compile server. Can be used to determine the order in which the mapping for a specific module is changed. Can be used to debug compile errors

:files from module
each machine has custom configuration files which must be copied to a machine directory. if the auto wsm configuration chart(not released for v6.00) is selected in the checklist, then only robot.tps file is transferred other wise you will also get the wsm file that needs to be configured manually. 
>click the button "files from module"
>select "moduleFilesToMachineFolder"
>in the instruction list window select suppress warnings and click the OK
>start transfer, not file to transfer will receive error message

:MTU
>move software from
    -network to workstation
    -w2n
    -n2m
    -m2n
    
:Change m/c status
>prior to installing the software on the machine the machine status must be changed from "Not release" to "released"
    -release to production
    -not release to production
        on these case
        designer changes the machien status using the above change m/c status function
        the designer changes the machine configuration via the checklist program
>enter a release notes

:Cleanup backups
updateing or generating a machine if the tool needs to replace an existing file it will create a backup of the file by appending date and time stamp at the end of filename. 
click cleanup backups button will give user the option to delete these files

:utilities(imcomplete)
>archive machine
>generate configuration
>generate old data list
>hkobject configuration tool
>generate local plc modules
allows the designer to create the module structure on the local drive. Then designer can make modifications to the local plc files and merge his changes back to the modules.
    -data flow graphic
        sn<sn>.pro -> plcExport.exp -> plc Project = *.plc
        d:\pc platform\plc\<sn>
        d:\pc platform\plc\<sn>\temp
        memory
        d:\pc platform\plc\<sn>\modullib\
    -once finished modify modules, use codewright "directory difference" to compare directly locally generated modules with comdules in the module library.
>process electrical modules
>data logging champion
used by the data logging champion to perform tasks related to data logging. 
reference document, data "logging documentation"

:generate tester notes
calls the mtu to update the tester note files for the machine. Pressing this button ensures the tester notes on the machine reflect the most recent copy.

:General commands
>open machine folder(w:\mc\<s/n>)
>open modules, click on this button in order to open all the modules for the current machine in codewright. Use the filter to narrow down the list
>show m/c db files, reads and display the machine database fields in an extended machine detail window for the selected machine

:module interface
describe various task when using the module itnerface, such as opening, searching editing and creating modules.
WARNING: ONLY EDIT MODULES AFTER YOU HAVE OPENED AND CHECKED OUT THE MODULE USING THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURES. DO NOT EDIT MODULES DIRECTLY.
>Open module interface
    -open pc-base production utility
    -click "module interface"
        -search for a module, could use wild char '*'
        -check m/c info checkbox to dispay a detailed list showing all machines that use a particular module version
        -list box to clipboard button to copy the contents of the module list box to windows clipboard
>Edit a module
    -first search for a module
    -double click the list, the module is opened in codeWright for editing
    -right click the module
