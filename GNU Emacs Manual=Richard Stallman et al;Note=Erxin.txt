# Preface
- run emac tutorial by c-h t 
- self-documenting display editor 
ftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/pdf/AIM-519A.pdf
- distribution
- the organization of the screen 
- Point, current cursor position
- echo area, the very bottom 
for example display current point information by, c-x = 

also use echo area to display minibuffer, you can input arguments, you could get out of it by c-g 
- if you miss a message from the echo area, you could switch to the *message* buffer to check the previous messages 

the message buffer is limited to a certain number of lines, specified by the variable message-log-max 

- the Mode line, describes what is going on in the current buffer, at the botton of each window, text format is 
cs : ch-fr buf pos line (major minor)
    + cs describes the character set of the text in the buffer, if a dash (‘-’), that indicates no special character 
    
    + The character after cs is usually a colon. If a different string is displayed, that indicates a nontrivial end-of-line convention for encoding a fie.
    + the ch, is indicate modify situation, -- unchanged, ** modified, %* modified read only buffer, otherwise %% 
    + fr, gives the selected frame name 
    
- the menu bar, F10 to invoke menu bar by keyboard or with command menu-bar-open
check full name of a menu item by c-h k then select the menu bar with the mouse usual way 

- character and keys and commands 
- entering and exiting emacs 
start in linux 
$ emacs &

inhibit-startup-screen variable is determine whether or not show the start up screen 

exiting emacs , c-x c-c
on text terminal, use c-z 

- basic editing commands 
del, run the command delete-backward-char

to insert a character which are non-graphic, typing c-q (quoted-insert), for example insert del character by c-q DEL 
use c-q octal digits, to insert the characters, also could use 
c-x 8 RET infinity RET 
C-x 8 RET 221e RET 

- changing the location of point 
c-f, c-b, c-n, c-p, c-a, c-e, M-f 
M-r, moving the text on the screen 
m-<, move to the top of the buffer 
m->, move to the end of buffer( end-of-buffer )
m-x goto-char, read a number n and move point to buffer position n
m-g m-g, read a number n and move point to the beginning of line number 
m-g g
c-x c-n, use current column of point as the semipermanent goal column 
c-u c-x c-n cancel the gobal column

- erasing text 
del, backspace, delete 
c-d delete the character after point 
c-k kill to the end of line 
m-d kill forward to the end of the next word(kill-word)
m-del 

- undo changes 
c-/, undo the entry of the undo records
c-x u
c-_ the same 

- files 
open file, c-x c-f 
save file, c-x c-s 

- help 
c-h k, describe-key followed by the key of interest, for example c-h k c-n tell you what c-n does 
- blank lines 
insert blank line, c-o 
delete consecutive blank lines, c-x c-o 

- continuation lines 
text terminal, will display '\'
c-k kills a logical line
c-n next-line and c-p previous-line 

with auto-fill model, emacs will break a line when it becomes too long 

- Cursor position information
m-x what-line, display the line number of point 
m-x line-number-mode
m-x column-number-mode 
m-=, display the number of lines, words and characters are present in the region
m-x count-words, statistic the buffer 
c-x =, display the character code after point(what-cursor-position)
m-x size-indication-mode, toggle automatic display of the size of the buffer 

- numeric arguments 
m-# command
C-u (universal-argument) followed by some digits
insert fie copies of ‘0’? Type M-5 C-u 0

C-u alone has the special meaning of “four times”: it multiplies the argument
for the next command by four. C-u C-u multiplies it by sixteen. Thus, C-u C-u C-f
moves forward sixteen characters. Other useful combinations are C-u C-n, C-u C-u
C-n (move down a good fraction of a screen), C-u C-u C-o (make “a lot” of blank
lines), and C-u C-k (kill four lines).

C-u 6 4 a inserts 64 copies of the character ‘a’. But this does not work
for inserting digits; C-u 6 4 1 specifis an argument of 641.

M-q (fill-paragraph) fils text; with an argument, it justifies the text as well
