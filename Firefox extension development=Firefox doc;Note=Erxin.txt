- development command flags 
As of Gecko 2 (Firefox 4), JavaScript files are cached ("fastload"). The -purgecaches command-line flag disables this behavior. Alternatively, you can set the MOZ_PURGE_CACHES environment variable.

- enable debug environment settings or manually set by about:config 
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/devprefs/

- firefox global installation directory 
Copy the .xpi file into the <installation directory>\extensions

If you want to do a silent administrative install that immediately makes the extension available to limited users

     to uncompress the .xpi file yourself (as a ZIP file) to an appropriately named (extension's ID) folder. On Linux/Unix platforms you can use a helper script to determine extension IDs in an automated fashion. 
     
start Firefox as a user who has write permissions to <installation directory>\extensions and agree to have the items installed; then Firefox will uncompress the .xpi file to the extension's folder.      

- installation directory 
Windows

Examples of default installation directories:
Firefox	C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\
Firefox (64-bit Windows) 	C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\
Thunderbird	C:\Program Files\Mozilla Thunderbird\
Mozilla Suite	C:\Program Files\mozilla.org\Mozilla\
SeaMonkey 1.x 	C:\Program Files\mozilla.org\SeaMonkey\
SeaMonkey 2.0 	C:\Program Files\SeaMonkey\

Example search for Firefox: firefox.exe

    void shutdown(data, reason)
    
    void install(data, reason), this function is called before the frst call to startup after extension is install 
    
    void uninstall(), called after the last call to shutdown() before uninstalled. It's important to keep in mind that uninstall() can be called even on extensions that are currently disabled, or are not compatible with the current application,  fires on downgrade and upgrade as well...

        * services.jsm, do so via privileged javascript code 
        Components.utils.import("resource://gre/modules/Services.js")
        
        * no more resource://URIs for files internal to your bundle 
        
        * load your jsm from chrome://
        
        * audit any remaining resource://URI usage internal to your extension 
        
        * no more nsIFile access for files internal to your bundle 
        use addon manager api to load data 
        use nsIZipReader to load data 
        use XMLHttpRequest to load data 
        
        * maually handle default peferences,
        reference default preference, the key part of any extension is the default settings that come with it. 
        https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Default_Preferences
        
         User supplied prefs are set using the GUI and also by modifying a profile's prefs.js file (which uses the user_pref() function)
         
        for packed extension, you can either load a module similar to firebug's preLoader.js or load this work around module 
        
        * no more internal JAR files 
        
        * no more xul overlays, XUL element you need to create for your add-on to add your interface, it needs to go into a XUL window

        * bootstrapjs, in the root of you xpi 
        
        * bypass when loading properties files 
        
        * put it all together, the new entry point of your add-on is via bootstrap.js:startup() rather than a load hadnler in a XUL overlay 
        
- legacy extensions, use XUL overlays to specify the interface, apis available to previleged code such as tabbrowser and javascript modules to interact with the application and content 
  
it is superseded by restartless extensions and add-on sdk 

- working with multiprocess firefox, migrate to chrome style 

- compare extension thechniques 
    + reference

    all sdk based extension is restartless 
    + manually boostratpped restartless extensions, more low level way to develop extensions than the sdk 
    for mobile need a new code base. it support wrap android widgets 
    
    in manually boostrapped and code running in a traditional overlay extension it automatic chrome previleges giving it access to browser objects like tabbrowser and xpcom
    
    restartless extensions have relatively complex cleanup requirements that they must satisfy when they are disabled or uninstalle
    
    + legacy overlay based restartful extensions, use XUL to define the user interface. it doesn't works with android
    
    after install the user must restart. javascript code automatic get chrome previleges. give access browser objects like tabbrowser as well as XPCOM objects
        * advantage XUL overlays are very powerful and can integrate very deeply with the browser's UI.
        * disadvantage 
        don't works with android 
        xul is large complex and mozilla specific 
        required restart browser 
        compatibility of the apis your code relies on is not guaranteed across versions of the host applications 
    
- XUL migration guide, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Guides/XUL_Migration_Guide. should you migrate? 
    + your add-on can accomplish everything it needs using only the supported api, it's a good candidate for migration 
    + needs lots of thrid party packages low-level apis or xpcom, then the cost of migrating is high, may be not worth it 
    + it is possible to migrate the code from overlay to restartless, but no XPCOM components of your own.

XUL script or javascript xpcom script using Components.utils.import() or Components.utils["import"]()

- create a javascript code module 
//my_module.jsm 
var EXPORTED_SYMBOLS = ["foo", "bar"];

function foo() {
  return "foo";
}

var bar = {
  name : "bar",
  size : 3
};

var dummy = "dummy";

//import the my_module

Components.utils.import("resource://app/my_module.jsm");

alert(foo());         // displays "foo"
alert(bar.size + 3);  // displays "6"
alert(dummy);         // displays "dummy is not defined"

- url for a code module, code modules can only be load using a chrome:(), resource:, or file:uri 
    + extension for firefox 4 already have chrome.manifest with content instructions, then put your code module in your content folder and reference it like other content files via 
    chrome://<yourextension>/content/<module_name.jsm>

- sharing objects using code modules, Components.utils.import() is cached the module, two imported module in different js file will use the same cache version. so the changes in both js file will effect each other 
multiple import will not reload the loaded module 

- unloading code modules, Components.utils.unload unload a previously imported code module 
- extending resource urls, Gecko 2.0 te most common way to load code modules was using resource:urls 
resource://<alias>/<relative-path>/<file.js\jsm>

multiple pre-defined aliases setup by the xul runtime 
app, alias to the location of the xul application 
gre, alias to the location of the xul runtime 

alias must be unique to your add-on 

- using chrome.manifest, add custom aliases by registering an alias chrome manifest 

resource aliasname uri/to/files/

- programmatcally add alias, aliases to paths that can be represented as nsILocalFile can be programmatically added as well 
// Import Services.jsm unless in a scope where it's already been imported
Components.utils.import("resource://gre/modules/Services.jsm");

var resProt = Services.io.getProtocolHandler("resource")
                      .QueryInterface(Components.interfaces.nsIResProtocolHandler);

var aliasFile = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/file/local;1"]
                          .createInstance(Components.interfaces.nsILocalFile);
aliasFile.initWithPath("/some/absolute/path");

var aliasURI = Services.io.newFileURI(aliasFile);
resProt.setSubstitution("myalias", aliasURI);

- custom modules and xpcom components
    + prior to Gecko 2.0 javascript xpcom components are loaded before chrome registration, you have to moving the call the Components.utils.import() into the XPCOM constructor 
    
    + you should not typically put your javascript code modules in a jar file in your add-on 


# js-ctypes 
- introduction 
js-ctypes allows application and extension code to call back and forth to native code written in C. C++ support is possible through vtable pointers see Using COM from js-ctypes

other work made possible by js-ctypes is JNI, this is elaborated in the JINI.jsm. The JNI.jsm JavaScript code module abstracts all of the js-ctypes required for writing JNI code.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/JNI.jsm

- js-ctypes is only available from chrome code that is ctypes is not available to websites only application and extension code 

- using js-ctypes 

//import 
Components.utils.import("resource://gre/modules/ctypes.jsm")

    + load native library 
var lib = ctypes.open("user32.dll");

    + library search path 
    application dir 
    system dir 
    16-bit system 
    windows directory 
    
    + close library 
lib.close();

- call window api 
Components.utils.import("resource://gre/modules/ctypes.jsm");

var lib = ctypes.open("C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\user32.dll");

/* Declare the signature of the function we are going to call */
var msgBox = lib.declare("MessageBoxW",
                         ctypes.winapi_abi,
                         ctypes.int32_t,
                         ctypes.int32_t,
                         ctypes.jschar.ptr,
                         ctypes.jschar.ptr,
                         ctypes.int32_t);
var MB_OK = 0;

var ret = msgBox(0, "Hello world", "title", MB_OK);

lib.close();

- declare function by 
const clock = lib.declare("clock", ctypes.default_abi, ctypes.unsigned_long);

console.log("Clocks since startup: " + clock());

    + return values, if return value could be fit into javascript nubmers(32bit or smaller, or is a double or float) then just use javascript number, other wise will return a ctypes object 

- declaring and using callbacks, A callback is declared by using ctypes.FunctionType The first argument is the calling convention, the second argument is the return type, and the third is an array of arguments the callback expects. 

var myFuncTypeDeclaration = ctypes.FunctionType(ctypes.default_abi, ctypes.boolean, [ctypes.int, ctypes.voidptr_t]);

function myJSCallback(cInt, cPtr) {
    return true; // as the return of the FunctionType was ctypes.boolean we must make our javascript callback return boolean otherwise js-ctypes will throw error saying unexpected type return
}

var myCCallback = myFuncTypeDeclaration.ptr(myJSCallback);

//callback return void and no arguments 
var myFuncTypeDeclaration = ctypes.FunctionType(ctypes.default_abi, ctypes.void_t, []);

function myJSCallback() {
    return undefined; // as the return of the FunctionType was ctypes.void_t we must return undefined OR dont return at all otherwise js-ctypes will throw an error saying unexpected type
}

var myCCallback = myFuncTypeDeclaration.ptr(myJSCallback);

- using callbacks 
function myJSCallback(foo, bar) { .... };
var funcType = ctypes.FunctionType(...);
var funcPtrType = funcType.ptr;
var regularFuncPtr = funcPtrType();
var callback = funcPtrType(myJSCallback);

//or use online code 
var callback = ctypes.FunctionType(...).ptr(function(...) {...});

    + js-ctypes automatically handles the conversion between arguments and return values, for complex tpes temporary CData objects will be created 

- declaring types 

    + primitive types 
var i = ctypes.int32_t(5);

some_c_function(i.address());

    + declaring new primitive types 
const DWORD = ctypes.uint32_t 

    + structure, Structures are declared using the ctypes.StructType() constructor. 
const struct_tm = new ctypes.StructType("tm",
                        [ { "tm_sec": ctypes.int },
                          { "tm_min": ctypes.int },
                          { "tm_hour": ctypes.int },
                          { "tm_mday": ctypes.int },
                          { "tm_mon": ctypes.int },
                          { "tm_year": ctypes.int },
                          { "tm_wday": ctypes.int },
                          { "tm_yday": ctypes.int },
                          { "tm_isdst": ctypes.int } ]);

    + Opaque structures, whose content fields are not known. You can then define the fields in the opaque structure later by calling the CType object's define() method.
    
var someStructure = ctypes.StructType("someStructure");
var anotherStruct = ctypes.StructType("anotherStruct", [ {field1: opaque.ptr} ]);
someStructure.define([ { ptrToAnotherStruct: anotherStruct.ptr } ]);

    + arrays, To declare a new array type, you use the ctypes.ArrayType() 
    
    //declare with unspecify length 
const FILE = new ctypes.StructType("FILE").ptr;      // Create FILE as a FILE * type
const FileArray = new ctypes.ArrayType(FILE);        // Create a FileArray type

    //declare with specify length 
const FileArray = new ctypes.ArrayType(FILE, 20);

    + pointers 
const IntPtr = new ctypes.PointerType(ctypes.int);

//point to user 

- memory management, when binary code hands back a pointer/handle to allocated memory the js code must make sure to free that memory with the correct allocator. usually will need a free function from the library 

- keep objects alive 
    + a function or static data declared using declare() will hold that library alive 
    + directly access the contents of a CData object using address(), addressOfElement() or contents will not keep the object alives 
    
    + closure 
    + when in doubt, malloc(), positively need data around you cn use malloc()
    
- standard os libraries 
    + reference https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/Using_js-ctypes/Standard_OS_Libraries
    + winapi 
    + com 
    + gdk 
    + gtk+ 
    + x11
    + mac os x
    + cocoa 
    + android can be used by js-ctypes through the JNI libraries 
    
- type conversion 
    + reference https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/js-ctypes/Using_js-ctypes/Type_conversion
    + implicit convert, done automatically in the function callback method 
    
    + explicit convert, js-ctypes, data could be converted explicitly when passing to CData constructor 
    ctypes.int32_t("123");
    
    explicit convert will try implicit convert first. then use the constructor function to convert the value 
    
- working with ArrayBuffers, ArrayBuffer's are simply byte arrays. In js-ctypes this is a ctypes.uint8_t.array(###) (ctypes.unsigned_char are also ctypes.uint8_t).
    
// context is a CanvasRenderingContext2D of some canvas
var imageData = context.getImageData(x, y, w, h);
var array = imageData.data; // array is a Uint8ClampedArray
var buffer = imageData.data.buffer; // buffer is a ArrayBuffer

// incomingBuffer is a TypedArray
var imageData2 = context.createImageData(w, h);
imageData2.data.set(incomingBuffer);

- working with data, data types for use with js-ctypes are represented by CType objects. 
//create an array 
let arrayType = ctypes.ArrayType(ctypes.int32_t);
let myArray = new arrayType(5);

//type casting 
var newObj = ctypes.cast(origObj, newType);

erxin	Does anyone know, if the extension developed with XPCOM will be deprecated in the new version of Firefox? Thanks.
10:42	gkatsev	erxin: it's at least a year out
10:49	erxin	So what is the best technology to developing an add-on to fit for the future Mutiprocess Firefox(Electrolysis). 
10:53	erxin	I plan to use JavaScript+CSS+Html + js-ctypes with necessary native logics. Does this will work in the future? Thanks.
10:54	noida	no other options erxin
10:54	noida	the webext api is under development
10:54	noida	which uses xpcom itself lol so im not sure
10:54	noida	i just keep going like normal
10:57	erxin	@noida So during the mid ages we still have to use XPCOM?
10:57	noida	yep
10:57	noida	i think though webext api and sdk abstract things so they'll change the underlying xpcom to servo whenever that happens
10:57	noida	so try using those without using require('chrome')

- firefox 
Does anyone know, if the XPCOM extension will be deprecated in the new version of Firefox? Thanks. 
09:47	Mardeg	erxin: I'm not familiar with an extension of that name, got a link?
09:48	erxin	XPCOM is not a extension. It is a technology supply by mozilla which is like the MS COM
09:48	erxin	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM
09:49		*** Cydrobolt quit (Quit: oooh...what does THIS button do?)
09:49		*** Matthew quit (Quit: This computer has gone to sleep...)
09:49	Mardeg	erxin: yeah they're deprecating that over the next year, but your use of "the new version" made it sound like you were worried about a specific extension
09:50	erxin	Yes currently our product have a Firefox extension which is implemented with native c++ XPCOM
09:51	erxin	Does this kinds of extension will be deprecated? As I known XPCOM also support implemented with JavaScript
09:52		*** Cydrobolt joined #firefox
09:52	erxin	So I'm curious if the XPCOM will be deprecated or not in the future. 
09:53	Mardeg	firebot: xpcom end bugs
09:53	ssokolow	Ugh. Well, I found a workaround. It was trivial to modify my export_tab_groups.py script so it would read Session Manager saved sessions so now I can just waste my entire afternoon reinventing Tab Groups in a more trustworthy manner.
09:53	Mardeg	well they weren't helpful results
09:54		*** jrgill quit (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
09:54		*** joe9 joined #firefox
09:55	ssokolow	I'd say "this sort of thing is why Firefox lost so much market share" but Chrome has a history of actually losing session recovery DATA rather than just losing the metadata.
09:55	erxin	There are lots of documents, I'm diving into the sea of docs.. x(. Is there a technical roadmap for mozilla?
09:55		*** Matthew joined #firefox
09:56	Mardeg	erxin: looks like your extension will be among those talked about at https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebExtensions/FAQ#Which_add-ons_will_stop_working_when_XUL.2FXPCOM_is_deprecated.3F
09:58	erxin	Yes current it is implement with XUL/XPCOM. I'm the one who is chosen to upgrade it to fit for the new standard.  
09:59		*** bbondy quit (Connection closed)
10:00		*** mastizada1 joined #firefox
10:00		*** bbondy joined #firefox
10:00	Mardeg	erxin: in that case you should /join #extdev
10:00	erxin	So, does the XPCOM will be deprecate or just the XUL layout? 
10:00		*** mastizada quit (Ping timeout: 121 seconds)
10:00		*** mastizada1 is now known as mastizada
10:01	Mardeg	and ask more specific questions in that channel
10:01	markh	erxin: I think both of them are aspirational goals rather than something that will happen soon
10:01	erxin	@Mardeg Thank you.
10:01	Mardeg	don't expect your extension to still work in 2017 onwards, just sayin' 
10:02	markh	I'd say 2019 
10:03	markh	(but there are 2 questions here - what we prevent extensions doing vs what Firefox itself does. For Firefox itself, we also want to get rid of xpcom and xul, but we have no plan on how to do that or what will replace them)
10:03	Mardeg	erxin: if the extensions isn't signed by Mozilla then it'll stop working in Firefox 42 anyway
10:33	erxin	@Mardge If we just install manually install the extesion into the firefox profile. Then do we have to sign the extension?
10:34	erxin	@Mardeg,  sorry for the typo 
10:35	Mardeg	yes, there won't be a way to circumvent it in normal Firefox
10:37	erxin	Thank you, for let me know that. 
10:37	Mardeg	erxin: see https://wiki.mozilla.org/Addons/Extension_Signing#FAQ
10:40	erxin	@Mardeg, Got it. Thank you! 
10:41	Jan\	erxin: there is a blog post about this
10:41	erxin	?
10:42		*** marco left #firefox ("")
10:42	Jan\	erxin: https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/08/21/the-future-of-developing-firefox-add-ons/
10:43	Jan\	erxin: have you read that post before ?
10:43	erxin	Does it means the best way to implement a extension is use pure JavaScript+CSS+Html + js-ctypes with necessary native logics. This will fit for the future multiprocess version of Firefox?
10:44	Jan\	erxin: did you read the blg post ?
10:45	erxin	@Jan, I did read it before. Thank you Jan.
10:45	erxin	I didn't read it -.-. sorry @Jan
10:47	erxin	Mistake input again. x_x...
10:48	markh	erxin: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.platform/XPhyLaFdH3o/NDmLF7kpLAAJ may help in terms of the recommended future way to incorporate binaries with your addon
10:48	markh	(the entire thread is probably worth reading)
10:52	erxin	OK. Lots of tabs are opened. I will read them all. ~ Thank you @markh

* Firebug - extension for Firefox that allows to monitor HTTP 
communication for specific URL (see the Net panel for more info, some 
docs: http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/firebug/firebug-net-panel-timings/) 

* NetExport - extension for Firebug/Firefox that allows to export data
