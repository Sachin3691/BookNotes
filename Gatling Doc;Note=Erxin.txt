# Gatling
- it is performance testing framework. it is open source  http://gatling.io/

- features 
    + record 
    + edit with dsl script 
    + integrate with window/linux, supported build tool 
    maven, sbt, jenkins 
    
    + analyze with report 
    
- relatives 
    + maven, http://maven.apache.org/
    + sbt, interactive build tool, http://www.scala-sbt.org/
    
# Quick start 
- download bundle http://gatling.io/#/download
- install jdk 7u6+
- for integrate with mave, make sure JAVA_HOME env is added 
- gatling default encoding is utf-8  use the gatling.conf to change 
- gatling script is writen in scala 

Scala is an acronym for “Scalable Language”. This means that Scala grows with you. You can play with it by typing one-line expressions and observing the results.

seamless java interop

many company like twitter, linkedin or intel

feels like script language

- test case, most of the gatling http features 
simulations 
scenarios 
feeders
recorder 
loops 

- application under test 
    + use a database deployed at http://computer-database.gatling.io 
    + also could deploy it on local https://github.com/gatling/gatling-computer-database
    
    + with play framework which is used for build webapp with java and scala 
    https://www.playframework.com/
    
- scenario, test performance is aim to representative of what really happens when users navigate it 

    + arraives at application 
    + user search for keyword 
    + open related models 
    + go back to home page 
    + iterates through pages 
    + user creates a new model 
    
- basic 
    + using the recorder, support record actions on a web application and export them as a gatling scenario 
    
        * linux 
        %gatling_home/bin/recorder.sh

        * window
        %gatling_home%\bin\recorder.bat 
    
    will launch a GUI 
    
    + configure the settings 
    + click start 
    + change browser proxy to use the gatling proxy, default is localhost:8000
    
    if contain out going proxy, don't forget to change the out going proxy 
    
    + record a sequence of actions 
    browser filter computer 
    add new computer 
    ...
    
    + click stop and save, the simulation will be generated in the folder 
    
- gatling scenario explained 
    + the produced output will be contain in the ouput folder

the optional package 
the required imports 
the class declaration note that it extends Simulation
the common configuration to all HTTP requrests 

var is the keyword to define a consnt value 

the baseURL that will be prepended to all relative urls 
common Http header will be sent with all the requests 
the scenario definition 
a http request, named request_1. the name will be displayed in the final reports 
the url the requrest targets with GET 
some pause/think time the parameter unit is seconds 

- running gatling 
    + launch 
        * linux 
        $gatling_home/bin/gatling.sh 
        
        * window 
        %gatling_home%\bin\gatling.bat 
        
    will display a menu of simulation examples 
    
    + may get exception ThreadPriorityPolicy=42 is outside the allowed range [0...1]
    
    change the value to 0 

    
# Advanced tutorial 
- isolate processes for reuse 
    + abstract processes into object. Objects are native scala singletons. 
    
    + example create a search object 
object Search {

  val search = exec(http("Home") // let's give proper names, as they are displayed in the reports
    .get("/"))
    .pause(7)
    .exec(http("Search")
    .get("/computers?f=macbook"))
    .pause(2)
    .exec(http("Select")
    .get("/computers/6"))
    .pause(3)
}

    + now use the process to rewrite the scenario by 
var scn = scenario("name").exec(Search.search, processObject.property, ...);

- configure virtual users. 
    + create different kinds of virtual users 

val users = scenario("Users").exec(Search.search, Browse.browse)
val admins = scenario("Admins").exec(Search.search, Browse.browse, Edit.edit)

    + increase the number of simulated users 
setUp(users.inject(atOnceUsers(10)).protocols(httpConf))

    + ramp start the users 
setUp(
  users.inject(rampUsers(10) over (10 seconds)),
  admins.inject(rampUsers(2) over (10 seconds))
).protocols(httpConf)    

- using dynamic data with feeders and checks 
    + use dynamic data to simulate different users do different actions 
    
    + feeders are data sources containing all the values you want to use in your scenarios
    
        * CSV feeders 
        example 
        
//create a data file in user-files/data folder 
searchCriterion,searchComputerName
Macbook,MacBook Pro
eee,ASUS Eee PC 1005PE        
        
//declare a feeder and use it to feed our users with above data 
object Search {

  val feeder = csv("search.csv").random // 1, 2

  val search = exec(http("Home")
    .get("/"))
    .pause(1)
    .feed(feeder) // 3
    .exec(http("Search")
    .get("/computers?f=${searchCriterion}") // 4
    .check(css("a:contains('${searchComputerName}')", "href").saveAs("computerURL"))) // 5
    .pause(1)
    .exec(http("Select")
    .get("${computerURL}")) // 6
    .pause(1)
}

- looping, extract the repeated exec block to a function. indeed simulation's are plain scala clases so we can use all the power of the language if needed 

object Browse {

  def gotoPage(page: Int) = exec(http("Page " + page)
    .get("/computers?p=" + page))
    .pause(1)

  val browse = exec(gotoPage(0), gotoPage(1), gotoPage(2), gotoPage(3), gotoPage(4))
}

    + another built-in structure. the repeat builtin is a loop resolved at runtime. it takes the number of repetitions and optionally the name of the counter that's stored in the user's session 
    
object Browse {

  val browse = repeat(5, "n") { // 1
    exec(http("Page ${n}")
      .get("/computers?p=${n}")) // 2
      .pause(1)
  }
}

- check and failure management, we have only used check to extract some data from the html response and store it in the session. 

but check is also handy to check properties of the response. by default gatling check the http reponse status is 20x or 304
    
    + example 
import java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom // 1

val edit = exec(http("Form")
  .get("/computers/new"))
  .pause(1)
  .exec(http("Post")
  .post("/computers")
  .check(status.is(session => 200 + ThreadLocalRandom.current.nextInt(2)))) // 2
  
ThreadLocalRandom to generate random values. we check a condition that's been customized with a lambda. it will be evaluated every time a user executes the request and return 200 or 201 

we use tryMax method and exitHereIfFailed constructs 

val tryMaxEdit = tryMax(2) { // 1
  exec(edit)
}.exitHereIfFailed 


# General 
## Concepts
- virtual user, load testing tools suc as ab or wrk. each one have its own data and maybe taking a distinct browsing path 

- scenario, a group of user behaviors. it is a workflow 
    + example 
scenario("Standard User")
  .exec(http("Access Github").get("https://github.com"))
  .pause(2, 3)
  .exec(http("Search for 'gatling'").get("https://github.com/search?q=gatling"))
  .pause(2)
  
use pause to simulate the user think time 

- Simulation is a description of the load test. it describes how possible several user populations will run which scenario they will execute and how new virtual users will be injected

    + example 
val stdUser = scenario("Standard User") // etc..
val admUser = scenario("Admin User") // etc..
val advUser = scenario("Advanced User") // etc..

setUp(
  stdUser.inject(atOnceUsers(2000)),
  admUser.inject(nothingFor(60 seconds), rampUsers(5) over (400 seconds)),
  advUser.inject(rampUsers(500) over (200 seconds))
)

- Session, each virtual user is backed by a session. Those sessions are the actual messages that go down the cenario workflow. it is a state placeholder where testers can inject or capture and store data 

- Feeders for tester to inject data from an external source into user's session 

- checks, gatling use checkers to analyze the response. also can be used to capture some elements and store them into the session for reused later such as build next request 

- assertions are used to define acceptance criteria on gatling statistics 

- reports, by default reports are automatically generated at the end of simultion. 

## Bundle structure 
- structure
/gatling-home 
    /bin, contain the launch script 
    /conf, configuration file 
    /lib, libraries used by gatling
    /user-file 
        /simulations, contains your simulations scala files, respect package folder hierarchy 
        /data, contain feeder data 
        /bodies, contains templates for request bodies 
    /results, contains simulation.log and reports generated in sub directory 
    
## Operations 
- java version JDK7u6. if launch script are not available on your JVM, please remote it 

- ipv4 and ipv6, disable ipv6 which may cause performance issues by command line options -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -Djava.net.preferIPv6Addresses=false

- OS tuning adjust to increase the max socket connection number for your os 

    + most os use 
    $ ulimit -n 65536 
    
    + linux change the /etc/security/limits.conf 
    *       soft    nofile  65535
    *       hard    nofile  65535
    
## Configuration 
- config log level logback.xml 
- gatling.conf use HOCON format(human-optimized config object notation, https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md)
- command line options 
- $JAVA_OPTS
