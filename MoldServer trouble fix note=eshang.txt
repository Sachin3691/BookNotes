Mold Server trouble fix note=eshang

:Restore the database from back up files
But we could restore the database by this sql script:
RESTORE DATABASE MoldMaintenance FROM DISK = 'd:\MoldServerOperational_backup_2011_09_20_180004_3835309.bak'
   WITH MOVE 'MoldServerOperational' TO 'C:\Husky\MoldServer\DatabaseMoldMaintenance.mdf',
        MOVE 'MoldServerOperational_log' TO 'C:\Husky\MoldServer\DatabaseMoldMaintenance_log.ldf'
        ,REPLACE
Use this to check the Logical back up name and log name
RESTORE filelistonly FROM DISK = 'd:\MoldServerOperational_backup_2011_09_20_180004_3835309.bak'

:VMware image of windows server 2008r2 + sql server 2008 r2 + share point 2010

:Sql server 2008r2 can't access the backup database file from the desktop
When I try to restore the backup files from the desktop, the access is denied. So I move the back up files to the local drive and create a new folder then the restore script works fine.

:Sidewinder route all its outbound traffic
I configured the sidewinder to route all its outbound traffic through 10.0.97.1 as the default gateway using the command:
route add default gw 10.0.97.1
Once you reboot the sidewinder these changes will be removed, so to make it more permanent someone should add this line to its configuration.

:New features to achieve
>TagID will not be programmed during engineering tests, however we can add validation when generating HKUpdate for ensure
>Add version field for service, application and database
>

:Sidewinder connected
We met problem that workstaions not in the same subnet cannot be connected to Sidewinder.
for example computer with address 10.0.3.x cannot connect to Sidewinder 10.0.97.x.
That's the problem that default gateway is not set correct in Sidewinder.
this can be done using the command:
route add default gw 10.0.97.1
In order to do the config to Sidewinder, you may follow the steps:
1. linkSidewinder to a Workstation  with RS232 cable
2. login to it and start "putty.exe"
3. choose Serial, 115200 bps and conect to the sidewinder
4. Press enter when black window show up. User “root” and no password.
You can also connect through Network telnet:
1. Start Putty.exe at remote workstation
2. enter SiderWinder IP as Host Name(IP address)
3. select Telnet as Connection type
4. Click open to connect
please be noticed,
if the sidewinder reboots, these changes will be removed.
