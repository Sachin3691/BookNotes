# What is cloud native?
- enter cloud native 
- DevOps is that it promotes and prescribes regular, continuous integration and the continuous delivery of new and improved code (called CI/CD for short). 
- the concept of containers, which have become increasingly popular in the past five years. Containers permit developers and development teams to package software, along with everything needed to run it, into a single executable package, very small size compared to VMs 

-  Kubernetes is the tool of choice for automating the deployment, management, scaling, networking, and availability of containerized applications.

-  In the cloud environment, development teams must oversee a variety of tasks involving configuration, coordination, and management of cloud computer systems, while also managing resources such as scheduling and software. Together, these tasks are called orchestration

tools including Mesos/Marathon, Docker Swarm, and, of course, Kubernetes.

- Microservices acknowledge the fact that many applications are easier to develop and maintain when they can be subdivided or broken down into small pieces that work together. it can scale independently 

- Rapid recovery, fast return to full service after an outage or larger disaster.

- Resilience, Considered by most to be a primary goal of DevOps, resilience (more specifically application resilience) defines the capability of an application to respond to problems in one of its many components

- Multitenancy, multitenancy implies a single software solution serving multiple “tenants” or customers on a hardware that is usually serving multiple customers. Each customer has unique and sole access (has specific privileges) to this shared system. 

- OpenStack,  OpenStack is an open source platform specifically designed for cloud computing. It is often deployed as Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), wherein virtual servers and other cloud resources are made available to users.

- Cloud-native development typically will include heavy usage of DevOps processes, microservices, and containers. These all are elements of Agile

simplified deployment process for different kinds of cloud and infrastructure. 

- OpenText is one of several companies offering solutions
