- what are the loadrunner components 
    + virtual user generator or vuGen 
    + the controller organizes drives manages and monitors the load test 
    + analysis helps you view dissect and compare the results of the load tests 
    
- terminology 
scenarios, defines the events and occur during a testing session, base on performance requirements 
virtual users and vusers, emulate the actions of human users 
vuser script, the record actions of a business process performance in your application 
protocol, a protocol is the method of communication between a client and the server 
transaction, the measure the performance of your system, represents one or more end-user business processes 
script footprint, defined by the quantities of the various recourse that are required on a load generator in order to execute the vuser script 

- testing process 
planning -> script creation -> scenario definition -> scenario execution -> results analysis 

- define performance requirements example 
    + the application must successfully handle 10 concurrent travel agents 
    + must be able to process 10 simultaneous flight booking with response time not exceeding 90 seconds 
    + mst be able to handle 10 travel agents running simutaneous itinerary checks with response time 
    + must be able to handle 10 agents signing in and signing out 
    
- starting hp web tours, the sample application of hp web tours, load runner support over 50 types of applications 
demonstrates how to load test a web-based application 
    + start the sample web server 
Select Start > All Programs > HP Software > HP LoadRunner > Samples > Web > Start Web Server.
    + openHP web tours 
    start > all programs > hp software > hp loadrunner > samples > web > hp web tours application

    + Add localhost to the Exception Site List.
    a. On the LoadRunner machine, open the computer's Control Panel.
    b. Search for Java, and double-click Java (32-bit) or Java 64-bit. The Java Control Panel opens.
    c. Click the Security tab and click Edit Site List. Click Add and enter http://localhost:1080. Click
    Continue to approve the address.
    
    + log on
    user name: jojo
    password: bean 

    + reserve a flight 
        * click flights 
        * change arrival city to los angeles 
        * continue 
        * find flight page, accept the default flight selection and click continue 
        * in the payment details click continue
    + end your hp web tours session 

- requirements 
    + 10 concurrent travel agents 
    + process 10 simultaneous flight bookings with response time not exceeding 90 seconds 
    + handle 10 travel agents, no exceeding 120 seconds 
    + handle 10 agents signing in and signing out of the system 
    
- building a vuser script 
    + introducing vugen 
    + create a blank user script 
    + recording a vuser script on 

- introducing vugen, it works on a record and playback principle 
    + open Virtual User Generator
    + Make sure the Category is Single Protocol
    + select web - http/html and click create 

- record a vuser script 
    + enable vugen to record the actions Record->Record Options, select General->Script, make sure that the track processes created as COM local servers check box is cleared 
    + record the vuser script steps 
    + click record 
    + configure the pop up dialog, select record list to web browser 
    + select microsoft internet explore 
    + type url 
    + click start recording 
    + make required operations
    + stop recording 
    + save the vuser script 
        
- viewing the vuser script 
    + solution explorer check the script structure 
    + the step navigator could help check the script steps 
    view the step navigator by View|Step Navigator 
    + the vuGen editor displays a text-based view of script 
    
    
# lesson 2, replacing your script 
- the general run-time settings include 
run logic, the number of times that a vuser repeats various sections 
pacing, the time to wait between repetitions 
think time, the time vuser stops to think between steps in the script 
log, the level of information that you want to gather during playback 
speed simulation, users using different network connections such as modem DSL and cable 
browser emulation, users using different browsers to see their application's performance 
content check, for automatically detecting user-defined errors 

- run-time setting dialog box 
Replay -> Run-time settings 

- general branch
    + set the run logic settings, set number of iterations for the vuser script 
    + pacing settings, set random intervals 
    + log 
    + think time settings, keep the default think time setting, if you run the script under VuGen, it will run quickly since it will not include the think time 

- run the Vuser script 
    + open a Vuser script in VuGen 
    + click replay->run 
    
- when can I view information about the replay?
    + after a Vuser script finished could check the summary 
    + View->output 
    + click the replay log link in the replay summary tab 
    make sure the replay is selected in the output tab 
    
- search and filter the replay results 
    + expand an iteration node in the tree 
    + view a result snapshot 
    + view the step summary 
    + search for a result status 
    
    
# solving common replay problems 
- many server use unique session id for every new session
- preparing hp web tours for replay errors 
    + open hp web tours 
    start -> all programs -> hp software -> hp loadrunner -> samples -> web -> web tours applications 
    + change the server options 
        * click administrator link on the hp web tours home page 
        * select the set login form's action tag 
        * scroll down to the bottom of the page and click update 
        * in the bottom click return 
        
- work with unique server values, use VuGen to detect the need to correlate the session id, you could instruct VuGen to insert a step that saves the original session id to a parameter, in the replay session, VuGen saves the new original session ID to a parameter 
    + record a new user script with dynamic values 
    + replay the new script, replay -> run 
    + scan the script for correlations, Design -> Design Studio 
        * will find three values for the tours website 
        * the longest is the session id 
        * select the session id entry in the correlation tab 
        
    + examine the syntax of the correlation statement, example 
web_reg_save_param_regexp(
...
);

    + play the script again 
right click the web_reg_save_param_regexp, and select go to step in replay log 

    + reset the hp web tours server to ignore unique session ids 
        * start->all programs -> hp loadrunner -> samples -> web -> hp web tours application 
        * lick administration link 
        * clear the set login form's tag to a error page check box 
        * scroll down to the bottom of the page and click update 


# Preparing a Vuser script for load testing 
- measure the duration of a business process 
    + design a series of actions you want to measure by including actions in a transaction 
    + loadrunner gathers information about the time it takes to perform the transaction 
    + insert a transaction into a Vuser script 
    + click step navigator tab 
    + insert a start transaction marker 
        * in the step navigator locate the step image 
        * double click the image search flights 
        * click view -> steps toolbox 
        * in the steps toolbox, select lr_start_transaction
        * in the transaction name box enter find_confirm_flight and click ok, VuGen inserts an lr_start_transaction step in the step navigator  
    + insert a end transaction marker 
        * in the step navigator locate the step reservations.pl_2 step to display the corresponding web_submit_data step 
        * under common, select lr_end_transaction, drag it into the editor, release it after the web_submit_data step 
        * make sure that find_confirm_flight appears in the transaction name box 
        
- emulate multiple users, parametrize your script to make Vuser use parameter file 
    + find the section where you want to vary the data 
        * select view->step navigator 
        * step navigator locate the submit data, reservations.pl step 
        * right-click the submit form, reservations.pl select show argument 
    + change the fixed value to a varying value 
        * select seatPref 
        * click ABC icon adjacent to the seatPref argument, select or create parameter 
        
    + create parameter 
        * parameter name type seat 
    + specify values for the parameter 
    + define how the test will vary the data 
        * keep the default setting that instructs VuGen to take a new value for each iteration, update value on each iteration 
        
- verify web page content 
    + text check 
        * click step navigator tab to display step navigator 
        * locate the submit form, reservations.pl step 
        * on the VuGen toolbar, click the snapshot button to display the snapshot pane 
        * double click the snapshot icon 
        * View->Steps Toolbox 
        * type in web_reg and locate the web_reg_find step 
        * drag the web_reg_find step 
        * in the find text dialog box, type find flight into the search for specify textbox 
        * VuGen inserts a web_reg_find step into the step navigator 
    + image check 
- produce debugging information, recommended to check fail status, insert a output message 
    + click step navigator 
    + locate the last step, image SignOff button 
    + double click the image, sign off button step, display the corresponding web_image function 
    + under common locate the lr_output_message function 
    + in the message text box type flight was booked 
    
- did the replay of my test success? by default the image and text check is disabled, you have to enable them in the run-time setting 
    + enable image and text check 
        * Replay -> Run-TIme settings 
        * internet protocol -> preferences 
        * select enable image and text check 
        
    + run the script 
    + locate the text check 
        * click the output pane and select replay 
        * click replay log and then press ctrl+f 
        * search for web_reg_find 
        the first instance says as follows 
        web_reg_find started 
        
        click find next to display the next instance of web_reg_find, the second instance says as follows 
        registering web_reg_find was successful 

        this is not the actual text check, it only prepares VuGen to check for the text after the form submission 
        
        click find next to display the next isntance of web_reg_find, this instance indicates 
        registered web_reg_find successful for "text = find flight"(count = 1)

    + locate the begin of a transaction 
        * in the replay log, press ctrl+f to open the search dialog box 
        * search for word transaction 
    + view the parameter substitution 
        * search parameter in the replay log
