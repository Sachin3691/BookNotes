# Programming with visual c++ 
- this book is concentrates on using the microsoft foudation classes(MFC) with c++ for building desktop application 

    + window 7/8 
    
hardware <-> window 7/8 <-> window api(win32) <-> native c++ 
                                              <-> MFC <-> native c++ 
                                              
    + window 8 
hardware <-> window runtime(winrt) <-> native c++

- window 8 apps are different, you specify the GUI in xaml and xaml is used to generate c++ program code for GUI 

- learning c++, STL 
- console application 
    + have non of the baggage required for window program 

- window program concepts 
    + can access the input and output facilities of computer only by way of functionssupplied by the host environment 
    
    + no direct access to the hardware 
    
    + several program can run parallel, window os always has primary control of all communication with user 
    
    + user action are regarded by all window events, window program are event driven 
    
    + structure graphic 
user actions/hardware signal to events 
{keyboard, mouse, other event...}

program data, your desktop application 

- integrated development environment, IDE

    + solution file introduction 
*.sln, project solution 
*.suo, user options 
*.sdf, intellisense for the solution 
*.opensdf, state of the project 

    + display project property by alt+f7 
    + modify code 
#include "stdafx.h"
#include <iostream>
int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[])
{
    std::cout << "Hello world!\n";
    return 0;
}

_tmain is defined to be either main or wmain in the tchar.h file 

- setting options 

- creating an MFC application, use MFC application wizard 


## Data, variables and calculations 
- c++ program structure 
    + main 
- namespaces 
- variables in C++ 
-defining variables and constants 
- basic input from the keyboard and output to the screen 
- performing arithmetic calculations 
- casting operands 
- variable scope 
- what the auto keyword does 
- how to discover the type of an expression
