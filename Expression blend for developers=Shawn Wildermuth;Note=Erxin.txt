    + effects
    + clipping masks
    
# Layout with blend
- Understanding layout
    + the basic layout could be changed in the design panel
    + the same could be done in the design view by the lock symbol
    + min, max width, design size is different in real size by set the width height to auto
    + if the width changed less than half of the design size, it will automatic change to fix size
    + grid
        * click the column above will add column or row

    + the record could be pause by the red circle button in the design view
- Using Behaviours
    + add behaviours to bind the event and the story board for the control
    + ex. Behaviour -> Add ControlStoryboardAction
    + the event source could be change by the sourceName text box or by drag the aim symbol to the source object
- Blend and Visual Studio Workflow

    + right click to edit any xaml file to edit it in blend from visual studio
    
# Advance topic
- using sample data
    + in the right table with are properties, resources and data tabs the data tab support use data from the project and document level
    + also support import xml or create sample data from class
    + the added data structure support automatic add sample data from built-in sample such as string, boolean, image, int
    + bind the data to sample data
        * the gold colour of the property is binded to a data property
        * use the property of each datasource
        * support drag drop the data item to the control to bind the data
        * edit the data bind expression xaml to format the output
        {binding objProperty, StringFormat=c}
- shared resources
    + convert the color to resource, click the square beside the colour editor, support save the colour at the current doc or app level
    + convert the brush to resource
    + resource dictionary
        * add the already created colour or brushes into created resource dictionary by drag drop
        * the resource dictionary is automatic add link into the app.xaml this make the syntax {staticReource Name} could find the resource dictionary

    </style>
- control templates
    + is a part of style 
- refactoring into user controls
    + the new drawed elements could be convert into control from the tool menu|make into control, select the base control type to make the draw change to the control's style template

        * convert these into control
    + To custom the standard control by edit the control template each of the controls may compose with multiple parts, the part which need to changed should be edit with the specify template
    + the control template could specify with template binding to some specify control property this let the use could custom some specify template even use the custom control
    
# Platform specify tasks
- using sketchflow
    + use to build prototype app
    + sketchflow project could be deploy to the product
        * scktechflow could also use the sample data to generate preview layout
        * the deployed project is hold in the sketchflow player which support create feedback on line and save the feedback as file
