Data Science from scratch=Joel Grus;Note=Erxin

# Preface 
- data science 
data science lies at the intersection of:
Hacking skills
Math and statistics knowledge
Substantive expertise

- If you become a data scientist, you will become intimately familiar with NumPy, with scikit-learn, with pandas, and with a panoply of other libraries.  They are great for doing data science.  But they are also a good way to start doing data science without actually understanding data science.

# Introduction 
- the ascendance of data 
- joke of data science, data scientist is someone who knows more statistics than a computer scientist and more computer science than a statistician. 

- motivating hypothetical dataSciencester, DataSciencester has a strong “not-invented-here” mentality, we’ll be building our own tools from scratch. 
- finding key connectors 


# a crash course in python 

# visualizing data 
- matplotlib, using the matplotlib.pyplot module. you can save the figure by savefig() or display it by show() 

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

years = [1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010]
gdp = [300.2, 543.3, 1075.9, 2862.5, 5979.6, 10289.7, 14958.3]

plt.plot(years, gdp, color='green', marker='o', linestyle='solid')
plt.title("Nominal GDP")
plt.ylabel("Billions of $")
plt.show()

- other libraries 
seaborn is built on top of matplotlib and allows you to easily produce prettier (and more complex) visualizations.
D3.js is a JavaScript libraryfor producing sophisticated interactive visualizations for the web.Although it is not in Python, it is both trendy and widely used,and it is well worth your while to be familiar with it.
Bokeh is a newer librarythat brings D3-style visualizations into Python.
ggplot is a Python portof the popular R library ggplot2,which is widely used for creating “publication quality” charts and graphics. It’s probably most interesting if you’re already an avid ggplot2 user, and possibly a little opaque if you’re not.
