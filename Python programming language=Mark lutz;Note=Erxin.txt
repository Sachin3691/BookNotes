# python object storage module
Pickle, shelves

# web interface 
Zope, django, webware
CGI, script
Python have a CGI module
Python webserver, baseHttpServer, CgiHttpServer
Urllib, use to download webpage and sends request.

# System scripting tool
Sys and Os modules 
Glob, for file name expansion
Socket, for network and ipc
Time
Thread and queue, for concurrent threads 
Fcntl, low level file control
Sys.modules, is the set of loaded modules
Sys.exc_info(), Exception detail

# communicate with shell command
Txt = os.popen('type filename.txt').read()
Or use readlines
Python script stream redirect and pip is same as dos
Replace the sys.stdin, sys.stdout, save the streams and replace these two and restore back when finished

# file and directory
Parsing packed binary data with struct module

# parallel system tools
Os.fork
Os.execv, is.execl
Thread
Queue, automatic control the thread lock and only allowed one thread to update the queue at the same time 
Atomic operation
Exit the program, Os.exit, sys.exit will trigger the system build in exception, thread.exita
Ipc, interprocess communication 
Pip, anonymous pip and named pip, like a fifo file, could also do binary communication like files, use pipin, pipout = os.pip()
Manually flush output.
Unbuffured mode, to avoid deadlock
Os.mkfifo, to create named pip
Signal, signal.signal(int, signalHandler); signal.pause() to block the current thread and wait for the registed signal happen
- signals are a way to poke a stick at a process
signal.signal(signum, onSignal), regist a signal number and a callback
signal.pause, make the process sleep until the next signal is caught
- other ways to start programs
    + os.spawnv and os.spawnve calls were originally introduced to launch programs on windows, much like a fork/exec call
    + os.system call can be used on windows to launch a dos start command
    + pywin32 extension call have other functions such as winexec
    + subprocess moduels
    + os.startfile call
 
 
# System Examples utilities
- splitting and joining files
- a regression test script
    + glob,  finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell. 
    + glob, finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell. 
- pyunit, doctest
- webbrowser module to open url in your installed webbrowser
- mimetypes standard library module to automatically determine the media type file


# System example, directories
- rewrite os.path.walk
- greps and globs in shell and python


# python GUI development options
tkinter, wxpython, pyQt, pygtk, jython


# Internet programming
- jython, and zope are large systems in their own right


# Charpter 13 Network Scripting
- The socket layer
sockets also be sued as a communication mechanism between programming running on the same machine
- Port numbers reserved for common protocols
80, nntp 119, ftp 20, ftp control 21, smtp 25, pop3 110, imap4 143, finger 79, telent 23, gopher 70	
- python network modules 
ftplib, python module
socket, low-level network communication support
cgi, server-side cgi script support
urllib, fetch web pages from their addresss
httplib, ftplib, nntplib
poplib, imaplib, smtplib, pop, IMAP(mail fetch), and smtp(mail send) protocol
telnetlib, gopherlib, telnet and goper protocol modules
htmllib, sgmllib, xml.*, parse web page contents
xdrlib, encode binary data portably
email.*, parse and compose email messages with headers, attachments
rfc822, parse email-style header lines
mhlib, mailbox, process complex mail messages and mailboxes
mimetools, mimify, andle mime-style message bodies
multifile, read messages with multiple parts
uu, binhex, base64, binascii, quopri, email.*, encode and decode binary(or other) data transmitted as text
urlparse, parse url string into components
SocketServer, framework for general net serviers
- ftplib is a good example of low level protocol programming
- more protocol standards, mantained by the Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF) and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority(IANA)
