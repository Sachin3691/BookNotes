# Solution projects and items
- common properties
    + Could set multiple projects as start up projects in the Solution properties 
    + In the Debug Source Files section, you can provide a list of directories through which Visual Studio can search for source files when debugging.
    + The Code Analysis Settings section is available only in the Visual Studio Premium and Ultimate editions. This allows you to select the static code analysis rule set that will be run for each project. 
- Configuration properties, Both projects and solutions have build configurations associated with them that determine which items 
are built and how. 
- Support specify project types by platform or CPU
- Project types, each project contains a project file (.vbprojor .csproj) that conforms to the MSBuild schema. 
    + windows, The Windows project category is the broadest category and includes most of the common project types that run on end-user operating systems. 
    + web, The Web category includes the project types that run under ASP.NET. 
    + Extensibility:This collection of templates is used to create add-ons to the Visual Studio IDE
    + Office
    + Cloud
    + Reporting
    + SharePoint
    + Silverlight
    + Test
    + WCF
    + Workflow
    + SQL server
- specify assembly and project info
- User account control setting, specify the UAC in the project's application manifest file
- Application framework, visual basic only
- compile, vb only
- build, c# and f#
- build events, pre and post build event
- debug
    + start action, when a project is set to start up project
    + start options, running a app with command-line arguments or running it on a remote computer
    + enable debuggers, Debugging can be extended to include unmanaged code and SQL Server. The Visual Studio hosting process can also be enabled here.
- references, vb
- resources
- services, Client application services allow Windows-based applications to use the authentication, roles, and profile services that were introduced with Microsoft ASP.NET 2.0.
    + client services are supported
    authentication, roles, web setting
- setting, Project settings can be of any type and simply reflect a name/value pair whose value can be retrieved at run time. Settings can be scoped to either the Application or the User. Setting are stored internally in the settings.settings file and the app.config file
    + Application-scoped settings are read-only at run time and can be changed only by manually editing the config file. 
    + User settings can be dynamically changed at run time may have different values for different users
- Reference path, Visual Studio resolves the reference by looking in the following 
directories in order:
    1. The project directory.
    2. Directories specified in this Reference Paths list.
    3. Directories displaying files in the Reference Manager dialog box.
    4. The obj directory for the project. This is generally only relevant to COM interop assemblies.
- Signing, which provides developers with the capability to determine how assemblies are signed in preparation for deployment. 
- My Extensions, VB only
- Security, The Security tab, illustrated in Figure 6-21, allows you to define the trust level that is required by your application to operate correctly.
- Publish
- Code analysis, Most developers who have ever worked in a team have had to work with an agreed-upon set of coding standards. Organizations typically use an existing standard or create their own. In the previous version need to use third party tool such as FXCop
- Web application project properties
The Web tab, shown in Figure 6-24, controls how Web Application projects are launched when executed from within Visual Studio.
- Silverlight app, contains three files by default,  a static HTML page, an ASP.NET web form, and a JavaScript file that contains logic for loading Silverlight applications and installing the run time if required.
- Package/Publish Web
- Package/Publish SQL,  You can allow Visual Studio to create SQL scripts for the database schema only or schema and data. You can also provide custom SQL scripts to be executed either before or after the auto-generated script.
- Web site projects
