- overview, is a new build platform, enable developer build project without install VS
    * basic element
        + project file, xml based
        + items, represent the inputs into the build system, can be used as parameters for tasks
        <ItemGroup>
            <Compile Include = "file1.cs"/>
            <Compile Include = "file2.cs"/>
        </ItemGroup>
        reference defined item by @(itemCollectionName)
        + properties, represent as key/value pairs that can be used to configure builds, compaire to items:
            1. items are store in collections, while properties contain a single scalar value
            2. items are can't be removed from their collections, while properties can have their value change after defined
            3. items can have metadata and can use the %(itemMetadata) notation, while properties can't
            4. ex. how to define property, a property must define in a property group element
            <PropertyGroup>
                <BuildDir>Build</BuildDir>
            </PropertyGroup>
            reference defined property by $(property_name)
        + tasks are reusable units of executable code used by MSBuild projects, you could write your own task by authoring a managed type that implements the ITask interface
