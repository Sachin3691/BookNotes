Table layout in CSS=Eric A.Meyer;Note=Erxin

# Table layout in CSS 
- table formatting 
    + visually arranging a table 
    css draws a distinction between table elements and internal table elements. internal table elements generate rectangular boxes that have context, padding and borders but no margins 
    
    grid cell indicate the basic table layout which correspond to the actual table cells. The table cell may span multiple grid cell 
    
    grid cell is theoretical contructs and they cannot be styled or accessed through DOM 
    
    + table arrangement rules 
    each row box encompasses a single row of grid cells 
    
    a row group's box encompasses the same grid cell as the row boxes it contains 
    
    a column box encompasses one or more columns of grid cells, the first cell is placed on the left for left to right languages and on the right for the right to left languages 
    
    a cell's box cannot extend beyond the last row box of a table or row group. 
    
    + table display values 
    display values:
    none | inline | block | inline-block | list-item | run-in | table | inline-table | table-row-group | table-header-group | tablefooter-group | table-row | table-column-group | table-column | table-cell | table-caption | inherit
    
    initial value: inline 
    
    applies to all elements 
    
    inherited no 
    
    computed value, varies for loated positioned and root elements specified 
    
    inline-table, specifies that an element defines a block level table. it defines a rectangular block that generates a inline box
    table-row, specifies that an element is a row of table cells 
    table-row-group, specifies that an element groups one or more table rows 
    table-header-group, visual formatting the theader row group is always displayed 
    table-footer-group, always display after other rows and row groups 
    table-column, this value declares that an element describes a column of table cells 
    
    + row primacy, asssumes that author create markup languages where rows are explicitly declared. columns on the other hand are derived from the layout of the rows of cells 
    
    + columns columns and columns group can accept only for nontable properties, border, background width and visibility 
    
    + anonymous table objects 
    <table>
        <td>Name:</td>
        <td><input type="text"></td>
    </table>
    
    will define an anonymouse table row to contains the two td 
    + object insertion rules 
    inserted object will include all consecutive siblings of the table-cell element.
    Consider the following styles and markup:
    system {display: table;}
    name, moons {display: table-cell;}
    <system>
        <name>Mercury</name>
        <moons>0</moons>
    </system>
    The anonymous table-row object is inserted between the cell elements and the system element, and it encloses both the name and moons elements.    
    
    if the table-row/col is omitted then an anonymous row/col will be added, if the child of row/col is not table-cell then an anonymous table cell will be added 

- table layers, css defines six individual layers on which the various aspects of a table are placed 
cells 
rows 
row groups 
columns 
column groups 
table 

It is important to remember that by default, all elements have transparent background, the background of table element will be visible "throught" cell rows columns and so forth 

- captions, HTML5, the caption element can appear only as the first child of a table element

value, top|bottom 

initial value, top 

- table cell borders
values, collapse|separate|inherit 


applies to, elements with the display value table or table-inline 

seperated cell borders, every cell in the table is separated from the other cells by some distance 

- border spacing, add distance between borders 
border-spacing 

values, <length> <length>?|inherit 

the first is horizontal and second is vertical 

- handling empty cells, reflected in the values of the empty-cells property 

values, show|hide|inherit 
init value, show 

if all the cells in a row are emtpy and all have an empty-cells value of hide then entire row is as if the row element were set to display none 

- collapsing cell borders 
    + elements with a display of table or inline-table cannot have any padding when border-collapse is collapse 
    
    there is never any separation between cell borders in the collapse borders mode 
    
    once they are collapsed the border between cells are centered on the hypothetical grid lines between the cells 
    
    + when two or more borders are adjacent they collapse into each other.
    
    if one of the collapsing bothers has a border-style of hidden, it takes precedence over all other collapsing borders 
    
    if all the borders are visible, then wider borders take precedence over narrower ones 
    
    + the corder width is same will take from the cell, row, row group, ...
