    + template installed with project
    + online
    + with your organization
    + create project template
    Design a plan and Save as type Project Template

- sort command
View | Sort

- switch gantt chart and tracking chart
View | Gantt chart

- check calendar
View | Calendar

- views, working with schedule details the way you want
    + project working place is called view
    + assignment details

    + zoom by timescale
    View|Zoom, timescale such as month day ..

    + switch timeline and detail, in the Split View group
    SplitView|Timeline
    SplitView|Detail
    check the timeline check box or detail check box
    
    + display the resource sheet in the ResourceViews|Resource Sheet

- Reports, seeing project status in new ways
    + view resource overview
    Report|View Report|Resources|Resource Overview

    + design report
    Report|Report Tools|Design|Table Tools|Design tab, will display a new tab in the ribbon toolbar

    under the Table Tools click Design tab, click Layout tab


# Simple scheduling basic
- starting a new plan and setting its start date
create new blank project
manually scheduled mode will keep display at the status bar

- edit project info
Project|Properties|Project Information

automatic display project info
File|Options |Project Options, click Advanced tab, select Prompt for project info for new projects

- setting nonworking days in the project calendar
project calendar defines the general working and nonworking days and time for tasks

in the project information there is a calender combobox, there are three build-in calender types
    + 24 hours
    + night shift
    + standard
    
then in the Project|Change Working Time will display relative selected calendar

add exception day at the lower table, click detail to set recurring holidays or other times off

- entering the plan's title and other properties
File | Info |Project Information, click advanced properties


# building a task list
- entering task name, suggest name pattern
    + use verb phrase
    + don't repeat task name if it need to organized into a outline
    + don't include resource name for the task
    
- setup task
    + click cell of task name column
    + type assign launch team members, each task have a unique id number
    + the pin with question mark indicate it's a manually scheduled task
    + manually could be treat as a place holder
    + click Task|Insert group to add task
    + add task duration
    30m 30 minutes
    6h  6 hours
    4d  4 days
    3w  3 weeks
    2mo 2 months
    
    project use 20 days as a default work month, to change this by File|Options|Project Options click Schedule

    schedule task to occur during nonworking as well as working time, enter elaspsed duration by preceding the duration abbreviation with a e

or
Double click a task and select Advanced tab and check mark task as milestone

- create summary tasks to outline the plan, the highest level summary tasks are called phases
phase, highest level summary tasks

stakeholders, in terms of major work items

tasks indented below a summary task are called subtasks

select tasks and Tab|Schedule|Indent Task, the upper task will automatic changed to summary
or
Task | Insert | Summary to directly insert a summary task
 
- project management focus, top-down and bottom-up planning
    + top-down, identifies major phases or components
    + bottom-up planning

- creating task dependencies with links, it's crucial to getting the full benefit of Project scheduling engine

predecessor, the first task of a project
successor, the second tasks

    + four task relationships
        * finished to start
        * start to start, a start time of a task depend on another task
        * finished to finished, finish date depend
        * start to finished, the start date of predecessor task determines the finished date of the successor task

    + gantt chart and Network Diagram views
    
    + in tables such as Entry table, 

    + link task to create dependencies 
    select two tasks, Task|Schedule|Link the Selected Tasks
    or

- setup resources
    + View|Resource Views | Resource Sheet
    add resource name
    if you want to insert resource, use Resource|Insert|Work Resource

- entering resource's maximun capacity, 100% maximum unit means that 100 percent of that resource's working time is available to work on assigned tasks
more than 100% means the resource is overloaded

- entering resource pay rates, overtime pay rate in the resource sheet
set default pay rate by File| Options|Project Options|Advanced | General Options |Automatically Add New Resource And Task checkbox and then enter the default pay rates

- Set password for a plan by File|Save As Click Tools and click General Options

# assigning resources(work resource) to tasks
- assignment is the matching of a resource to a task to do work
- benefit to assign resource are
    + who should be working on what tasks and when
    + have the correct number of resources to accomplish the scope of work
    + expecting a resource to work on a task at a time when that resource will no be available to work
    + check if overload a resource
    
- assigning work resources to tasks
    + track the progress of the resource's work on the task
    
    + when assign a resource to a task, then project calculate the result by scheduling formula
    
    + project assume that all the resource's work time can be allotted to the task
    
- setup assigning resource
Select a task name then Resource | Assign Resources and then select the resource name and click Assign
    
remove the resource in the same way

support assign multiple resource into one task
or
assign the resource in the task grid of Gantt view, use the Resource column to do the task
- check resource work detail
Select a task and View|Split View | Task Form, the detail resource information relative to the task is displayed, click Format|Work display the work schedule

- the scheduling formula, duration, units and work, in general the amount of work will match the duration unless you assign more than one resource to a task
Task_Duration * Assignment_Units = Work

- controlling work when adding or removing resource assignments, When a task is automatically scheduled, project gives you an option to control how it should calculate work on a task
Effort-driven tasks, the work of a task remains constant as you assign or unassigned resources, as more resource are assigned to a task the duration decreases

By default, effort-driven scheduling is disabled for all tasks you create in project, turn on effort driven scheduling for an entire plan or just specific task

    + increase duration, but keep the same amount of work
    + reduce duration, but keep the same amount of work
    
    + effort driven task, in the Task | Properties | Details click Effort driven to make the task duration effect by the assigned resource
    
- change all task to effort drive
File|Options|Schedule
    
effort drive task, if you assign two resource at the first time, it will make the task duration parallel assign to each resource, if you assign additional resource in the next time, then task duration will divide with the resource number

- assigning cost resource to tasks
    + work resource cost
    + cost resource cost, such as fixed dollar amount you enter when assigning the cost resource to a task
    + assign resource form and assign the Cost type resource, adjust cost column for the resource in the cost panel
    
- checking the plan's duration, cost and work, see indicators of a plan in project
    + who is assigned to do what work in the plan
    + how long will it take to complete the project
    + how much it cost
    
    + project status-reporting features
        * Time line of tasks
        View|Split View|Time line

        * Check the cost table
        View|Data|Tables|Cost

        * Entry, is the default gannt chart task view
        
        * Resource Overview
        Report | View Reports | Resources | Resource Overview
        
        * Project information

# Advanced Scheduling Techniques
- Visually highlight a task's predecessors and successors
- Adjust task links for more control over how tasks are related
- apply a constraint to a task
- create a calendar and apply it to a task
- change a task type to control how project schedules tasks
- See task relationships with task path
