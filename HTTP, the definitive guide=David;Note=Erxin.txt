# PartI. HTTP. The web's foundation 
- Resource, Web servers host web resources . A web resource is the source of web content. 
- Media types, HTTP carefully tags each object being transported through the Webwith a data format label called a MIME type. MIME (Multipurpose Internet MailExtensions). It is a textual label such as 

text/html 
text/plain 
image/jpeg
image/gif 
video/quicktime 
application/vnd.ms-powerpoint

URI, HTTP can retrieve the object. URIs come in two flavors, called URLs and URNs

- URIs, uniform resourceidentifier

- URLs, The uniform resource locator (URL) is the mostcommon form of resource identifier. 

- URNs, uniform resource name, or URN. A URN serves as aunique name for a particular piece of content, independent of wherethe resource currently resides.

urn:ietf:rfc:2141

currently urn is experimental

- transactions, An HTTP transaction consists of a request command (sent from client toserver), and a response result (sent from the server back to the client).

- methods 
GET, send named resource from the server to the client 
PUT, store data from client into a named server resource 
DELETE, delete the named resource from a server 
POST, send client data into a server gateway application 
HEAD, send just the HTTP headers from the response for the named resource 

- status codes 
200, OK
302, redirect 
404, not found 

- messages, consist of three parsts 

    + start line, the start line indicating what to do or happend for request and response 
    + header fields, separated by colon for easy parsing 
    + body, optional message body containing any kinds of data. 
    
- simple message example

- connections 
    + TCP/IP, HTTP is an application layer protocol. HTTP doesnâ€™tworry about the nitty-gritty details of network communication; in  Internettransport protocol, TCP/IP is choosen for network communication. It provides 
    
Error-free data transportation

In-order delivery (data will always arrive in the order in which it was sent)

Unsegmented data stream (can dribble out data in any size at any time)

    + network protocol stacks 
HTTP
TCP
IP
Network-sepcific link interface
Physical network hardware 

- conntions, IP addresses and port numbers
