Effective UI=Jonathan Anderson;Note=Erxin

# chapter 1, building an effective UI
- building great UX requires the combination of science, skilled craftsmanship, and art to address a subjective need.
- Engagement as the fourth wall
- keyboard layout for prevent typebar clashs
- give a refresh info to let the user known the content is refreshed such as in ebay desktop application 
- Intuitiveness and efficiency
- keep a strong focus on the user’s actual goals
- Delivery of relevant, valuable content, content-intensive products such as Wikipedia and Craigslist
- External consistency, such as brand information for a company 
- Appropriateness to context
- Trustworthiness, good UX has been the need to gain an maintain the trust of the user
- roles in project 
    + Stakeholders and product managers
        * Facilitate infrastructure decisions and connections to existing or third-party systems that support good performance
        * Work with the team to make tough choices when unavoidable performance issues force changes in approach

    + UX architects and designers
        * Settle on information architecture plans, interaction designs, workflows
        * Respond to performance issues discovered by the engineers
        * Develop friendly approaches to progress bars or component state changes
    
    + Technical architects
        * Design efficient approaches to managing the processing
        * Continuously audit the product architecture to look for performance bottlenecks 

    + Software engineers
        * Write code and design approaches that are efficient
        * Execute faithfully on the UX and visual designs in ways
        * Actively work with stakeholders, project managers, technical architects and UX architects
        
    + Quality assurance (QA) and user acceptance testing (UAT)
        * Work with actual users to identify where performance-related pain points
        * Stress-test the application to identify hidden performance issues
- redefine two fundamental terms 
    + design
    + development 
        
        
# chapter 2 Building the Case for Better UX
- product managers or leaders of business units who know deep down in their souls that their company could be doing better by its customers and employees if only they could figure out how and convince their bosses to feel the same. We call these people “champions of change” and are excited to find any opportunity to work for and with them
- Why Now Is the Moment for UX
    + motive, provide better UX in their customer facing application
    + means 
- Web technology is pushing the envelope


# chapter 3, Effective Planning and Requirements
- the uncertain and unknown
- No battle plan survives first contact with the enemy
- Friction in a Complex and Peculiar System
- a complex system that’s far greater than the sum of its part
- written functional requirements and specifications are inherently flawed 
- how framework requirements are built 
    + the needs of the business 
    + the needs of the user 
    + the technical and infrastructural constraint 
    + sample parameters 
        * business goals 
        * schedule 
        * budget 
        * user goals 
        * context constraints 
        * technical constraints 
        
- three-legged stool 
product = f( scope & schedule & cost )

- developing method 
    + water fall 
    brainstorm => requirements => design => implmenet 

    + big design up front, BDUF, pejorative for a sort of methodology 

    + agile
    early planning -> guideline => development 
    -----------planning--------
    

# chapter 4, bring together a team 
- better team 
- project leader
    + managed by the stakeholders, but they must manage the stakeholders 
    + manage the project team 
    + stand for firm fidelity to the business and user requirements, they fight to preserve a rational approach to uncertainty and the unknown 
    + carry the high-level vision for the product and are a living encyclopaedia of the cumulative knowledge developed throughout the project 
    + must be deeply immersed in the project and embedded in the project team 
    + project leader should 
        * have the time available to devote to the project 
        * be passionate about the project and dedicated to its success 
        * have the humility necessary to allow her to facilitate a process that will be guided more by other people's ideas and vision than her own 
        * excel at motivating people and enabling their success 
        * have the trust, credibility or clout necessary to wrangle stakeholders 
- stakeholders 
    + limit contact with the project team 
    + gateway to resources, guardians of precious information about the business's needs, the product's users, and specifics of different facets 
    + stakeholders must be experts in whatever field and domain of the business 
    + they may have little or no experience in developing innovative software 
    + professional service company stakeholders are almost always representatives of the client 
    + internal projects, are those people who control the budget 
    
- securing authority 
    + authority in rank 

- project team, all of the designers, engineers, project managers, and other project team members are together in one space.the process of building UX-focused software involves constant and active collaboration amongst all the roles and disciplines involved in the project

    + recognizing the primacy of the user's needs 

    + software engineer can let the technical expediency or a desire for elegance get them off track 
    + designer can get too focused on making something pretty instead of first make it functional 
    + other contributors can forget to set aside their assumptions and defer to the guidance provided by users and user research 

- get professional help 
- cost consideration, use professional and experienced resources radically

# chapter 5 getting the business perspective 
- defining success 
    + delivered on time, under budget
    + meeting specific goals
    + UX professional can focus exclusive on succeeding at meeting the user needs 
    + team member view success as meeting the isolate demands 
    + project leaders can get focused on pleasing their stakeholders 
    
- creating a project mission statement 
- determining project success criteria 
- exercising restraint, in the early days of a project there is a tremendous amount of valuable thought and enthusiasm. but left unguided and unrestrained, all of the ideas and enthusiasm can run amok. 

- apply the pareto principle, 80/20 rule 
- Omissions Aren’t Permanent
- Describing the product's users 
- Exercises to Identify Key User Attributes
- if there were big or contentious debates during the exercise, note the opposing arguments and reasoning for the conclusion. if a collection of attributes was consolidated into a single complicated one, offer some explanation of that consolidated attribute

- creating business requirements 
- Affinity diagramming, with this digram we could create cause effect diagram which is called Ishikawa diagram and also called fishbone diagram. it is used to determining the relative importance of business goals can be tricky. the goals are reflections of the diverse interests of your stakeholders; set the features to different groups by stakeholders and users 
    + essential, must have 
    + helpful, nice to have 
    + defer 
    

# Chapter 6, getting to know the user 
- valuing user research,
- combating pressure to skip user research, We’ve found that user research does nothing to delay a project because it allows designers to make decisions much more quickly and accurately

- key concepts in user research 
    + empathy
    understand the user's perspective 
    
- who should be involved in the research 
- finding research participants
    + users working for companies in different industries 
    + users managing budgets scattered throughout than $5-15m range 
    + users representing a mixture of men and women 
    + user of varying ages 
    
- determining the research sample size 
- making recording 
    + video camera is too disruptive or intrusive 
    + audio recorder 
- research through speaking with users 
    + user interviews, should be comfortable and conversational, rather than formal and rigid 
    difficulty, hoping, enjoyable part of the process, successful outcome, did that seen slow/fast/normal
    
    + research through direct observation 
- analysing the research observations 
- weaving user stories, produce information about user's goals, needs, insights, behaviors, idiosyncrasies
    + how users try to achieve their goals 
    + issues and difficulties 
    + frustrations and hope 
    + fits into the user's broader work or home life 
    + a day or moment in the life of a user 

- discovering user priorities 
- guerilla user research 


# chapter 7 initial product architecture 
- architecture analogy
- the initial product architecture team 
    + ux architectus, deal principall in design, interaction and workflow issues 
    + technical architects, who plan the technical underpinnings of the project 
    usability
    information architecture 
    graphic design 
    interaction design 
    human factors engineering 
    business process analysis 
    psychology 
    client or stakeholder management 
    deep exposure to software engineering practices and constraints 
    
- UX architecture , 
- contextual scenarios 
- mapping high level workflows 
- getting a lay of the land 
- making platform and framework choices 
- understanding data requirements 
- mapping interactions with other systems 
- finding shortcuts through third-party and open source components 
- discovering business logic 
- software architecture in big design up front 
    + uncertain
- project infrastructure needs 
    + source control 
    + graphic asset management 

- testing infrastructure and environments 
    

# Chapter8 the iterative development process 
- regarding process, add more feedback literal as possible
- finished iterations with something complete 
- improve feedback efficiency, such as use trac 
- provide latitude for waterfull process by change documentation of names 
    + requirements or specification to guideline or recommandation  in the early or project 
    + don't segregate the professional disciplines 
    + allow the time and budget for major changes after the first delivery 


# chapter 9 release and post release 
- manage your stakeholder's expectation
- the alpha and beta releases might have a specific meaning and specific demands to satisfy some bureaucratic requirement
- An alpha release is typically made when the product is feature-complete but there is still a significant queue of known issues; it
- The purpose of the alpha release is usually to widen the range of perspectives and increase the volume of feedback provided on significant issues.

- Beta releases are typically made when the product is functionally complete, and the majority of significant issues have been repaired.

- Beta releases go out to much wider audiences than alpha releases, often including a significant number of actual customers

- The marketing alpha release should be more like the development beta release so customers aren’t being exposed to significant defects. The marketing beta release should simply be a final or near-final deployment candidate.
