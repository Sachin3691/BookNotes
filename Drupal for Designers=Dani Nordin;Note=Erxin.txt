# Some things to rememeber about working with drupal 
- a quick and dirty guide to drupalspeak, common terms you'll find in drupal 
drupal core, the actual files that you download rom htpp://drupal.org, the opposed to contributed modules 
contrib, modules or themes that you install after drupal core 
module, a plugin that adds functionality to your site, http://drupal.org/project/modules 
theme, the templates that control the look and feel of a drupal site, custom themes should always reside in sites/all/themes folder and not in the core themes folder 
custom, modules or themes that you create from scratch for a particular site or use case 
sites/all, a folder within your drupal installation that contains all the files, including any contribute modules or themes 
hacking core, refer to the act of making customization directly to drupal core files, modules and so on, instead of putting you customization into sites/all 
node, a single piece of content 
constent type, type of node you're creating 
view, an organized list of individual pieces of content that you create within the site using the view modules. this allow you to display content related to taxonomy or content types
field, element of a data that can be attached to a node or other drupal entities 
block, a small piece of resusable content such as a sidebar menu advertising banner or callout box 
taxonomy, content categorie, most basic level it could be think as tags for cotnent 
users, roles and permissions, people or gonizationsthat have visited, or registered on your site.  the key to working with users lies in roles. drupal allows you to create unique roles for anything that you might need to happen on your site 
base theme, a set of theme files, usually downloaded from drupal.org and stored in sites/all/themes. child themes store in sties/all/themes/<client_name>. which hold project specific css, jquery and so on 
themers, the lovely folks in the drupal community who apply design elements to drupal theme templates.
template files(*.tpl.php), individual php files that drupal uses for template generation such as generate block, node etc 
template.php, the php file located in every heme's project folder. that contains all the theme hooks functions and preprocessors used by your site's theme 
theme hooks/preprocessors, bits of php code that you can use to override specific setings in your template files 

- discussing drupal with clients

wrap-up meeting/documentation 

- implementation plans, breaking up your work 


# Discovery and user experience 
- breaking down the project goals 
- project discovery 
    + to get a better understanding of the design challenge 
    + to put together a series of documents that will guide the design process 
- user experience, framing the design challenge  
    + user personas or scenarios 
    + an outline or matrix 
    + wireframe 
    + sketches of screen designs or user flows 
    + paper or digital prototypes 
    + content strategy documents, including a breakdown of site content

# Internationalization and localization 
- manipulating text, use mb_substr() to extract the character from string, it is used to operate multi byte string 

- sorting and comparing, construct a collator object 
$en = new Collator('en_US');
$da = new Collator('da_DK');

$en-sort($words);
$da-sort($words); //$words is a string array 

- localizing output MessageFormatter help us generate messages that are appropriately localized for different places 
$fmtfavs = new MessageFormatter('en_GB', $messages['en_GB']['FAVORITE_FOODS']);
$fmtcookie = new MessageFormatter('en_GB', $messages['en_GB']['COOKIE']);
// This returns "biscuit"
$cookie = $fmtcookie->format(array())
