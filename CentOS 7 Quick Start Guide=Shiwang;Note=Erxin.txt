run, Contains runtime data, variables, process IDs, lock files, and so on for processes started since the last boot. 
/run/media: Used as a mount point for removable devices such as USB, CDs, DVDs, and so on
var, Contains the variable data, specific to the system that persists across reboots.
/usr, Contains application files, shared libraries, and documentation.
    /usr/bin, essential user commands(ps, ls, cp...)
    /usr/sbin, system administration commands(fsck, shutdown)
    /usr/local, contains data and program specific to the local machine 
    /usr/include, header files to compile application 
    
/bin, symbolic to /usr/bin 
/sbin, symbolic to /usr/bin 
/lib, symbolic to /usr/lib 
/lib64, symbolic to /usr/lib64 
/mnt, temporary mount point for partitions and devices in filesystem tree 
/proc, virtual filesystem, psuedo-filesystem of the kernel, It contains dynamic runtime system information (for example, system memory, devices mounted, hardware configuration, and so on) 

- contain four content types 
static, unmodified until explicitly edited 
dynamic or variable, generally gets modified continuously 
persistent, remain even after reboot 
runtime, content mostly resides in memory

# Using man pages and help command 
- syntax 
$ man <command> 

- read from gnu info, The documentation contained in info pages can be read through the command line using info or pinfo commands
$ info <topic name> 

- get help 
$ <command> --help 

- other documents 
    + This documentation is installed on package installation and is conventionally stored in the /usr/share/doc/<packagename> directory. 
    
    + The CentOS documentation is available at https://www.centos.org/docs/, but is being merged with the RHEL documentation at http://access.redhat.com
    
- give description of commands several command 
whatis, database updated daily in centos 
whereis 
which, takes one or more command names as argument, returns the absolute path of the given command

# Working with text file 
- basic bash 
- vi editor 

# Compression 
- gzip 
$ gzip -r <dir> 
compress all files 

$ gzip -d *.gz 

- bzip2 
$ bzip2 * 
$ bzip2 -d *.bz2 

- xz, table lists the xz compression command and its description with some examples
$ xz *
$ xz -d *.xz 

- zip 
$ zip -r <target.zip> 
compress 

$ unzip *.zip 

- tar, tarball and then compress the whole archive together. Creating a single file bundle by putting multiple files together is known as archiving.

c, create an enw 
xv, verbosity 
f, file name of the archive 
x, extract
t, list contents 
z, use .gzip compression 
j, use .bzip2 
J, use xz compression 

$ tar cvf abc.tar file1 file2 file3
archive 

$ tar xvf abc.tar
extract all 

- tac command view content of a file backward from bottom to top 

$ tac /etc/resolv.conf 

- cut, display only specific columns 
$ cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd 

- tee, The advantage of using pipes is that you don't have to save the output of a command in temporary files before passing it to another subsequent command for processing. Add logging for the pipe 

$ command1 | tee <log> | command2 ...

- using grep for text matching 
grep [options] pattern [files]
