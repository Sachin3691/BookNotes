Programming python 3 2nd edition=Mark Summerfield;Note=Erxin

# Introduction
- logical operator, three operators; and, or, not; both and and or use short-circuit logic and return the operand and determined the result they do not return a boolean; not unary operator evaluates its argument in a boolean
5 and 2 # return 2
5 and 0 # return 0
- decimal number, import decimal
- complex number a+bj
- string format method is very strong
    + "Element {number} is {element}".format(**locals())
    + "{} {} {}".format("Python", "can", "count")
    + "The {0[animal]} weighs {0[weight]}kg".format(dictionaryObj)
    + "We have {0[1]} and {0[2]} in stock".format(listObj)
    + "{0} {0!s} {0!r} {0!a}".format(decimal.Decimal("93.4")), force representation form but only use ascii
- data collection
    + tuple
    + list
    + set
    + frozenset
    + dictionary
    + ordered dictionary, collection.OrderedDict, keys to be returned in the same order they were inserted.
- data collection operation
    + split
    + copy
    + sort
    
# control structure and function
- exception
    + try catch finally
    + raise exception
        * raise exception(args)
        * raise exception(args) from original_exception, the Chainedexceptions exception is raised as a chained exception 
        * raise, reraise the current exception and if there isn't one will raise typeError
- custom function
- global variable, global varname
- assertions, use to test variable's state, Preconditions and postconditions can be specified using assert statements
    + syntax
    assertboolean_expression,optional_expression
    if the boolean expression is false, assertion Error exception is raise
    + Once a program is ready for public release, remove the assert expression for the runtime by 
        * run the python command line by -O option, for example,python -O program.py. 
        * Another approach is to set thePYTHONOPTIMIZEenvironment variable toO.
    + remove the docstr from each function by -00 in the python command line

# module and package
- check a module name is in use is to try to import the module. this can be done by 
python -c 'import module'
- package, is simply a directory that contains a set of modules and a file called __init__.py
    + We must be careful to ensure that our top-level module name in the standard library
    + necessary line for the __init__.py file
    __all__ = ["Bmp", "Jpeg", "Png", "Tiff", "Xpm"]
    + the package could be nested
