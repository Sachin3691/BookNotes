OpenCV3 getting started with image processing=Robert laganiere;Note=Erxin

# Prerequisites 
- base on c++ api on opencv library 
- need good c++ dev environment 
- microsoft VS and QT 
- separate contriute repository, contrib 
- genereate library fiels and cmake tool 

# Playing with images 
- install the opencv library 
    + download opencv library 
    opencv.org 
    
    unzip the package into c drive 
    
        * decide platform for development 
        os, 
        version 
        ide 
        compiler 
        platform, 32/64 
        
        * opencv splite to two modules 
        opencv -> opencv source, core functions such as manipulate images 
                        contrib package, latest the algorithm 
        
        * use cmake to build the files 
        * use an additional toolkit VTK to install before compile 
        
    go to the github opencv/opencv_contrib and download as zip file 
        * rename the download source/modules to contrib and copy the contrib folder to root of the opencv directory 
        
    + download extra modules 
    + download cmake 
        * use the GUI build tool and select the source folder 
        * select the output folder 
        * before build look for the OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH to specify the previous contrib folder path 
        * click on OPENCV_ENABLE_NONFREE and click on configure again 
        * generate the project libraries, open the solution and select INSTALL project 
        * build the install project, build debug/release 
        the install folder will contain all the build output, contain binary files such as dll and libs of opencv 
        
        set the system path to the desire output locations 
        <opencv dir>\build\install\x64\vc14\bin 
        OPENCV_DIR point to the path then cmake could automatic configure the path for future projects 
        
    + linux install 
    use cmake to generate the make file 
    $ sudo make install 
    
    or use 
    apt-get to install 
    
    + mac use 
    Homebrew package manager 
    $ brew install opencv3 --with-contrib 
    $ brew info opencv 
    
    
    + the extra module have to be download from github, they make get more frequent changes 
    core, core functions opencv2/core.hpp
    imgproc, image processing opencv2/imgproc.hpp 
    highgui, for video highgui/hpp 
    
    
    
- opencv, bsd licenses 
    
- loading displaying and saving image 
- exploring the cv::Mat data structure 
- defining regions of interest(ROI)
