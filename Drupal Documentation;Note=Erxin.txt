# Structure, working with nodes, content types and fields 
- node, all content on a drupal website is stored and treated as "nodes", such as page, poll article, forum topic or a blog entry 

comments are not node but always connect to one 

a nodes has several default fields 

you can create custom fields and define you rown content types 

install modules may include additional fields 

node module manages these nodes, it lets you 
    + list, sort through and manage all the content on your site 
    + set defaults for how all posts are displayed 
    + list and configure the "content types" for your site and create new ones 
    
all node have a unique id 
- fields, field are managed by field module 

- working with content types and fields(drupal 7 and later)

content type, is a pre-defined collection of data types(fields), it always work in conjunction with views 

field, can be added an element, such as title, body, tags, image 

in drupal element is not a terminology it use 
    + entity type, such as node or taxonomy 
    + bundle, such as article or page 
    
- field ui model, provide a admin ui for managing fields 

most of the time we should reuse a field/custom field in content. this will help use create different fields for multiple kinds of content types 

one reason not reuse is different perimissions for uses 

    + delete fields php code 
field_delete_field($field_name);
field_purge_batch();

- create a custom content type 
- moduels that integrate with field module, views module is a great compliment to it, it allows you to filter sort and display your custom fields, https://www.drupal.org/node/1645232

get to the project page of the custom module will get more detail

    + semantic fields, provides the ability to customize and enhance the html output of a field, user can specify the html wrapper and element and classes for. currently it is not recommanded on production site will be release soon 
    + telephone
    + text 
    
- rearrange the order of field by field management page 
- specify how fields are displayed 
    + content can be displayed idfferent depending on whether it's in a list with similar content, in search results, or being viewed in full 
    
    + view mode drupal refers to the different ways a piece of content can be displayed as view modes, 
    
    all entities including user profiles taxonomy terms and blocks(d8 only)
    
    use entity view modes module(https://www.drupal.org/project/entity_view_mode) or display suite module(https://www.drupal.org/project/ds) to create your own view modes, extend layouts by installing field group(https://www.drupal.org/project/field_group)
    
    + changing nodes are displayed 
    admin|structure |content types , click manage display check the checkboxes next to the iew modes you want to customize and click save 
    
    + drupal define five view modes for nodes 
    full content, most detailed view of a node, you see this when you visit the url of the node 
    teaser, a short summary, display for listing pages 
    rss, 
    search index, display in the drupal internal search 
    search result 
    
    + taxonomy term page, you see this when you click on a taxonomy term link 
    + field label display options 
    above, inline, visiually hidden(d8 only), hidden

# Working with blocks 
- refernce, https://www.drupal.org/documentation/modules/block
- blocks are boxes of content( such as user login or who's online) that can be display in regions 
- blocks are placed in regions
- can be place different in different region on for different themes 
- assign weight for block, the ligher will flow up 
- block visiblity depends on 
    + whehter it is enabled and assigned to a region 
    + the throttle checkbox, throttle blocks are hidden during high service load 
    + page specific visibility settings, can also be hide for specific page or php code snippet(https://www.drupal.org/node/60317)
    + custom visibility settings, individual blocks can be configured so that users decide whether to show/hide certain blocks 
    + its function dynamic block may be empty on certain pages and will not be shown 
    
- when working with large number of blocks(more than 100), it may be necessary to incease max_input_vars in php.ini 

- add a custom menu to the header or footer of a views display(page or block)

    + drupal can recognize when a link is 'active' and add the proper css for the link 
    
    + enable php filtering to allow code in a view under admin/build/modules listed under core 
    
- blocks outside sidebars 
    + regions in phptemplate, https://www.drupal.org/node/29139
    + build your front page with regions, http://drupal.org/node/65064
    + using different block templates for different blocks, regions etc, http://drupal.org/node/104319
    
    + common request to putting block in a row above the content 
        * option a 
        create a region before content 
        create blocks to that region 
        using weighting and float:left to line them up in order 
        
        * option b, using miniPanels
      
        * option c
        create a region for each column of blocks 
        put them into a single row table in page.tpl.php 
        create and assign blocks to regions, weighting them so that they appear at the right palce in each column 

        
- blocktable, allows you to embed all the blocks in region into an html table, blocktable is the module, https://www.drupal.org/project/blocktable, deperacated 

- dynamic display block module enables you to create blocks to present content in a dynamic way. for create shlideshow effects it uses the jquery cycle plugin

# Entity api 7.x content, users, taxonomy terms, comments
- hooks provide drupal core and system module 
https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules!system!system.api.php

- entity api, drupal 8, The Entity System was introduced late in the Drupal 7 development cycle with basic standards for how entities were loaded.
https://www.drupal.org/node/2078191

- introduction to entities, explain entity types > bundles > fields > entities 
    + entity types, now we can add fields to comment, fieldable entities 
    nodes(content)
    comments
    files 
    taxonomy terms 
    taxonomy vocabularies 
    users

    + bundles, is a implementation of an entity type, could consider bundles as sbutypes of an entity type. With content noes(an entity type)
    
    you can generate bundles like articles, blog post or products. then you can attach fields to the bundles 
    
    + fields, a reusable piece of content, is a primitive data type 
    developer field api, https://www.drupal.org/node/443536
    
    + entity, would be one instance of particular entity type, such as comment, taxonomy term or user profile or bundle such as a blog post 
    
    use entity_load to laod any entity 
    
    + putting this in oop terms 
    
    entity is a base class 
    bundle is a extended class 
    field is a class member, property value 
    enttiy is an object or instance of a base or extended class

# Working with links and related content 
- link click count module, enable user to find number of clicks happend on the particular link 
- related link module, allow nodes to display related urls to the user via blocks 
    + parsed links 
    + manual links 
    + discovered links 
- web link manager for your site, web links module, https://www.drupal.org/project/weblinks, provides a comprehensive way to display and manage url links to external websites. all links are nodes, which may be put into taxonomies/categories for customised group 

- related content modules, provide information for help you manage related content 
    + associated nodes, associate nodes according to different criteria such as Taxonomy and CCK fields 
    
    you can give a different weight for each criterion 
    
    the main module doesn't provide any criteria. they are provied by other modules which are like plugins for associated nodes 
    
    associated nodes usage 
        * active the assicated module 
        * admin|settings|associated-nodes to configure the module 
        * create a new association and give it a name 
        * define the maximum number of nodes that can be associated to another node 
        * choose the types of nodes that can be associated 
        * select criteria of association and give them weights 
        * configure plugins features, such as taxonomy constraints 
        
    + associated links is not a plugin but a module that uses associated nodes, after enable the module, you will see a block at admin|build|block named "associated links:name-of-your-association"  
    
    for adminstrator can do 
        * recommend nodes 
        * recommend certain types of nodes 
        * recommend comments when viewing a node 
        * create a list of recommended users 
        
    + how to write a plugin you can define your own criteria of associations the main module of associate nodes provide API with useful function 
    
    you must implement following hooks 
    hook_associated_nodes_types()
    
    hook_associated_nodes_criteria($aid)    
    ...
