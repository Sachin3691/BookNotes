:expand vmware disk
2 - i just had to resize my vmware disk image from 8gb -> 12gb (single drive), and i recommend you do the following:
a) resize your disk
vmware-vdiskmanager -x 12GB image.vmdk
this will resize your disk, but it WONT resize the partition correctly.
b) use another vmware setup, add your disk as a secondary disk (so, it isn't a system disk)
c) boot other vmware setup
d) use the windows 'diskpart.exe' program to fix the partition
programs -> run -> diskpart.exe
show volume
select volume 2 (this may be another, check it)
extend
exit
e) shutdown, remove drive and startup original vmware

:expand partition software
