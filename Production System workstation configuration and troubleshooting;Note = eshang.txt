:OPTIONAL: SAVE EXISTING PROJECT DATA FROM THE EXISTING CONFIGURATION
This step is only required if you wish to save any data from the existing installation. To retain existing project data backup the following files:
Persistent PLC Data - C:\TwinCAT\Boot\ TCPLC_T_1.* 
Project TPS file – usually C:\TwinCat\default.tps (check the running project in regedit | HKLM | Software | Beckhoff | TwinCAT | Current Project)
Event History - D:\PC Platform\Husky COM\Data\EventHistory.mdb
Datalog Data – D:\PC Platform\Husky COM\Server\Datalog.tps
Robot Sequence Programs – D:\PC Platform\Husky COM\Data\Robot.tps
Sidebar Setup – D:\PC Platform\Husky COM\Data\UserProfile.tps
Project File – D:\PC Platform\PLC\SNxxxxxx.pro
Hardware Configuration – D:\PC Platform\PLC\SNxxxxxx.wsm

:Uninstall procedure
Remove the unused software from control panel
;
>Stop all services and devices
uninstalling sysCom, hkyCom, Twincat, some services and devices have to be stopped
;
run the stopAll.bat from w:\j\bin
for windows nt
    stop the twinCat system service
    stop the twincat router
    stop the twincat event logger
    check that no Tc- or Hk-server, Twincat system server or twincat event logger is running

:Install software that need to be updated
Run MTU
Select fullInstallOnWorkstation option

:Optional setting
>Check system configuration as follows
>Supporting software
    Required software version 'check'
>Ensure that the following software is installed on the machine that is going to use the PC Production tools:
	Operating system Windows NT 4 with Service Pack 6a, Windows 2000 SP3 or Windows XP with SP1 or SP2
	Beckhoff TwinCat. (Only if generating machine software)
	Microsoft Office including MS Access 97.

:GENERAL
These files are run to ensure necessary files are available on your workstation:
•	M:\users.bat
•	C:\BoltMap.bat 
Only for Luxembourg. Called only if batch file exists. This provides Luxembourg campus, mapped into a Bolton machine, access to Bolton drive mappings.
•	W:\j\bin\NTSetup4PCBase.bat
•	W:\j\bin\mdac28.bat
•	W:\j\com\UnRegisterLibrary.bat
•	W:\j\com\RegisterLibrary.bat -u

10.1.2	MACHINE
The following files should be executed to ensure necessary files are available on your workstation to run Machine Transfer Utility.
10.1.2.1	MACHINE BOOT
MapWDrive.exe – exists on disk image
MtuFromNetwork.bat - exists on disk image
W:\j\bin\machineTransferUtility.bat
	w:\j\com\RegisterLibrary.bat
	copy and register mscomctl.ocx if required 
W:\j\bin\MTULauncher.exe
	Enter serial number
	MTU.exe – mtu selected by project is called
CVTMTU.bat – replaces MtuFromNetwork.bat. Works the same, but calls MTU with the modified site configuration file, CVTSoftwareLoadSite.cfg. As a result, X: drive points to the modules, w: to everything else.

This file can be accessed from the disk image
10.1.2.3	MTUFROMNETWORK.BAT 
This file can be accessed from the disk image
10.1.2.4	W:\J\BIN\MACHINETRANSFERUTILITY.BAT
This batch file is used to run Machine Transfer Utility or MTU from the network.
10.1.2.5	W:\J\COM\REGISTERLIBRARY.BAT
This file copies and registers mscomctl.ocx if required 
10.1.2.6	W:\J\BIN\MTULAUNCHER.EXE
Enter serial number
MTU.exe 
MTU selected by project is called.
10.1.2.7	CVTMTU.BAT 
This batch file replaces MtuFromNetwork.bat. It works the same, but calls MTU with the modified site configuration file, CVTSoftwareLoadSite.cfg. As a result, X: drive points to the modules, w: to everything else.

:Configure a new PC
•	Ensure that a C: drive and D: drive is available. Typically the D: drive is set to 20GB with the remaining space used by the C: drive.
•	Ensure the basic office applications are installed.
    o	Word
    o	Excel
    o	PowerPoint
•	Install VmWare Player 6.0 (Free)
    o	Make sure that VMware is not installed,
    o	Install W:\PCBASE\Modulib\VmwarePlayer.001\VmPlayerAutoInstall.exe
•	Install Team Foundation Client.
•	Configure the environment – run the user.bat file.
•	Create PC Production Utility shortcut on the desktop for the default user.
    o	Copy the shortcut, W:\J\WinNT\PCProduction
•	Install supporting software: VB6.0, VC6.0, VB6 SP6, Access 97
    o	Run this batch file: W:\J\bin\IT Installation.bat
    o	Accept this dialog box
    o	Select VMWareInstallation.
    o	For this dialog, 
    o	1. De-Select All
    o	2. Suppress Warnings
    o	3. Select the indicated applications
    o	4. For MSOffice, deselect the office install and only select the access install.
    o	5. Press OK to start installation. The PC will reboot several times.
    •	When the configuration is complete, check it by running the ReadSoftwareVersion tool. See section Run ReadSoftwareVersion Program
•	Tell the user that if he wants to run twincat or HkyCom, he is responsible for installing it himself. You can refer the user to this document. An alternative is they can run a preconfigured vmware image found in w:\Virtual.
