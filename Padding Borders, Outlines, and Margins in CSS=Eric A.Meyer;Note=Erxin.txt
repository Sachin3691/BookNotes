Padding Borders, Outlines, and Margins in CSS=Eric A.Meyer;Note=Erxin

# basic element boxes 
- box model 
margin box 
border box 
padding box 
content box 
cotent area 

- width and height 
    + width, is defined to be the distance from the left inner edg to the right inner edge 
    values, leght|percentage|auto|inherit 
    initial value, auto 
    applies to all elements except nonreplaced inline elements, table rows and row groups 
    inherited no 
    percentages, refer to the width of the containing block 
    computed value, for auto and percentage values as specified otherwise an abolute length
    + height, is the distance from the inner top to the inner bottom 
    the height of element is always caculate automatically. the height is determined by the content of element not by the author 
    
- the height and width could change to relative to content box or border box as the area of measure by box-sizing 
box-sizing: content-box 

- padding 
background of an element extends into the padding by default. if the background is transparent this will create some extra transparent sapce around the element's content. 

prevent background extending by background-clip

by default element don't have padding 

when adding a border it's usually a good idea to add some padding as well 

padding values, to avoid use clockwise to remember this by think this is design for avoid TRouBle
padding: top right bottom left

- single-side padding 
padding-top 
padding-righ
padding-bottom 
padding-left 

- percentage values and padding 
percentage are computed in relation to the width of the parent element's content area.
padding on elements enlarge or reduces to amtch the actual size of the parent element. when use percentage the padding value string or expand when user changes the width of window 

the percetnage values of top and bottom padding is different for most positioned elements, they are calculated with respect to the height of the postioned element's containing block 

- padding and inline elements, when padding apply to inline or nonreplaced elements. the padding changes will effect the height of the element 

- padding and replaced elements. padding will push a replaced element's border away from its content. the padding value will effect the height of the element 

- border, border ahve three aspect, width or thickness, style or appearance and color 

the default color is forground color 
default width is medium 

an element has no text such as a table then the color will be the text color 

visible background can be prevent from extending into the border area by using background-clip

some border are intermittent then the background may extend to the visbile protion of the border 

- border style, it's possbile to define more than one style or a given border 
p {border-style: solid dashed dotted solid;}

- single-side styles 
border-top-style, border-right-style, border-bottom-style, border-left-style 

- border widths 
border-width 

- border color 
- single side border color 

- shorthand border properties 
    + single side 
border-top, border-right, border-bottom, border-left 

    + shorthand values 
border-width || border style || border-color || inherit 

- global borders 
border: border-width || border-style || border-color || inherit 

- borders and inline elements. setting borders will effect the height of inline element. if the the border is set to a image element then it will effect the height of the text 

- image border 
border: 25px solid;
border-image-source: url(i/circle.png);

to make border image appear we need to set a border-style 

    + border-image-slice, still use TRBL, support set with number or percentage
border: 25px solid;
border-image-source: url(i/circle.png);
border-image-slice:33.33%;

- creating a border overhang, if browser doesn't support border image, we could use border-image-outset to build 

- latering the repeat pattern, repeat 
late 2015 the only browser imlement space correctly was microsoft edge, with a fix pending of chrome 

    + use image to create a surround effect 
    {
        border: 2px solid blue;
        border-image: url(waves.png) 50 fill /20px /10px round;
    }
    
    the image may overlap the original border, but if the image is transparent then the border maybe displaced between the free space of the image 
    
- outlines, it is different from borders in three basic ways 
outlines do not take up space 
outlines may be nonrectangular 
use agents often render outlines on elements in the focus state 
outlines are an all-or-nothing proposition 

    + outlines cannot have a hiddent style, border can. outline can have auto style 
    
- outline width 
outline-width 
outline-color 

- outline doesn't effect layout 

- margins, setting a margin creates extra "blank space"

- percentages and margins 

- single side margin properteis 
margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left 

- margin collapsing, the process is which two or more margins that interact collapse to the largest of the interacting margins 

margin collapsing can be interrupted by factors such as padding and borders on parent element 

if you put a paragraph in a list item, without the specified margin-collpsing behavior the paragraphic's top margin would shove it downward, where it would be far out of alignment with the list item's bullet or number 

child of the margin collapsing with parent is pushing away any content that might come before or after the parent elemnt not the parent itself 

- negative margin 

- margins and inline elements, the height is not effect by margin 

margin only effect the lin-breaking by changing the point at which the element's content begins with a line 

the way margin are applied to the ends of each line box can be altered with the property box-decoration-break
