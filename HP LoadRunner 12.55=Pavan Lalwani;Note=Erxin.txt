# Analysis 
- Introduction to analysis 
Tools > Options > Scripting > Replay > Collect replay statistics 

the report will contain the transaction time in the replay report 

run the script again 

double click graph to maximize it 

    + analysis result could only be view which could not be edit 
    
    + introduce the summary report 
    
    + transaction summary 
    
    + http response summary 
    
    + save and you could also export 
- Service level agreement (SLA), sign between client and server 
    + describe the none function requirement document
    
    service level agreement to describe the software should meet the required speed 
    
    + add a SLA from the controller in the service level agreement panel 
    
    to set the transaction response time 
    
    follow the wizard to complete the setup 
    
    + after specify the SLA 
    
    + 
- Analysis overview 
    + introduce the graph

    the lower is the table for introduce the graph 
    
    the left bottom corner contain the introduction panel 
    
    + throughput graph 
    
    + transaction graph, display the transaction response time 
    
    right click a transaction column from the graph and select context menu "Drill down" it will display the detail information for the transaction 
    
    + average transaction response time graph 
    
    we could also select a line and select "drill down" from the context menu 
    
    + transaction performance summary

    we could add comment onto graph 
    
    + Report > HTML Report to generate html report 
    
    + connect ALM
    
# Correlation 
- Correlation introduction 
connection between two or more things 

correlation is done for the dynamic value or the value returned by serer for any request 

correlation is data which is sent to the client from the server, and later sent back to the server by the client 

correlation is where the script is modified so that some of the hard coded values in the script are no longer hard coded 

data return from the server for different users 

    + examples 
    session id 

- automatic correlation 
    + using design studio to complete the correlation 
    
    + open the recording options dialog and from the correlation tab 
    check rules scan 
    automatically correlate values found 
    record scan 
    replay scan 

    then after recording the design studio dialog will be opened 
    
    the correlation comments will be automatically added 

- manual correlation 
search for that value in the server response 

replace dynamic value present in the script which the LR parameter of the correlation function 

    + using beyond compare the two recorded scripts 
    
    record the web tour website and change the from London to Denmark 
    
    using the right corner text view request response panel to manually create the correlation 
    
    web_reg_save_param_ex 
    
    The user should select a dynamic value from the Server response within a snapshot,
    
    + addition functions for manually correlation, https://admhelp.microfocus.com/lr/en/12.60-12.61/help/WebHelp/Content/VuGen/Correlation/protocols/WebManualCorrelation.htm
    
web_reg_save_param_ex 	Registers a request to save dynamic data located between specified boundaries. 
web_reg_save_param_regexp 	Registers a request to save dynamic data that matches a regular expression.
web_reg_save_param_xpath 	Registers a request to save dynamic data from XML response using XPath expression.
web_reg_save_param_json 	Registers a request to save dynamic data from response that has been formatted as JSON.

user ordinal property control the sequence of the value 

    + we could debug the script execution by set break point 
    
- correlation ordinal value 
- correlation web_reg_save_param 
- loadrunner correlation_save_param
