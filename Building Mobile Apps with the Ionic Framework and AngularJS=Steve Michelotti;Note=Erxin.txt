# Getting start with ionic 
- overview 
    + ionic command line features 
    + starting a new project 
    + run your app 
    + ionic starter templates 
    + setting up your development environment 
    
- ionic command line features 
start, starts a new ionic project 
serve, starts a local development server 
platform, configure platform targets 
build, locally build app for a platform 
emulate, app in simulator 
run, run app on device 

- installing ionic 
    + install nodejs 
    + use console2 command prompt tool 
    + install ionic 
    $ npm install -g ionic 
    
    + install cordova 
    $ npm install -g cordova 

- starting a new project 
    + start a new project 
    $ ionic start [appName] [template]
    
    $ ionic start myApp blank 
    this command will create the directory structure 
    
    + open subline IDE 

- run the app with a browser 
    + local browser 
        * go to ionic project directory 
        * use serve command to start a development server 
        $ ionic serve 
        
        * instead of use chrome we could use canary which add newest of the chrome features, be forewared designed for developers and early adopters 
        
        canary with F12 will supply a emulation mode for perfect specify device size, it will also automatic change the user agent 
        
        * after change the code ionic will watch the file change and it will automatic restart the server 
        
- run the app with an emulator 
    + build the app 
    $ ionic platform add android 
    $ ionic build android 
    $ ionic emulate android 
    
- run the app on read device, if set platform to execute in the real device with android sdk 
$ionic platform and android 

- ionic starter template 
blank 
tabs, basic tabs navigation from the bottom 
sidemenu 
maps 

- setting up a development environment 
$ ionic start project-name tabs 
tabs is the template name 

$ ionic serve 
will start the developer service 

    + use the sidemenu template 
$ ionic start project-name sidemenu 
use the sidemenu template 

    + use sublime as IDE which is lightweight 
        * init ionic project 
        * open project directory 

- setting up a development environment with visual studio 
    + create new project 
    + select blank javascript template 
    + copy the previous ionic created project template and replace project files which is created by VS 
    + the code run under the teler simulator 
        
- setting up codepen, setting up a codepen account. it could be used as scrach pad 
http://codepen.io/ionic 

there are lots of example for ionic on the codepen.io 
    + similar to JSFiddler or Plunker for tring ionic
