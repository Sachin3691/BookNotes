:Overview
Sales use word/excel form collected the custormer requires by Machine Confirmation or Machine Checklist and collection of Word Change Notice(C/N) documents
CHECKLIST is a tool to enter or change the values of Machine Checklist and all Change Notices

:Create fucntion
>select the production line
Hylectric, HyPet, ISB, Quadloc, Thixo, Robot, Index, Other User chart
;
configure via Define Charts button

:Help Tool
Hylectric machines options list.doc, automatically for options and keywords in the document; with in the CTSTD module folder
the file is searched using the "Option Number field specified on the configuration sheets"

:Define chart
click the "Define Charts" button on the select checklist. Is password protected, (default password is HMI)
>Developer chart select
click "Developer chart Select" button, can select the revision level

:Edit Function
Edit or change the existing machine, user enters the machine's serial number. the "Create" button will change to "Apply changes"

:Compare function
Many machines can be edited or viewed at the same time as show below

:Change chart function
Upgrade existing machine to a new chart

:Errors and warnings
Errors indicate to the designer that these messages could break the machine. 
Warnings inform the designer about the changes that will not affect that particular machine. 
;
>For charts
specials and deviation charts, an error indicates that the chart was selected before any changes were made to the CTSTD configuration file and the chart is not visible for selection anymore in the checklist viewer. Warning indicates that the chart was not selected and is not visible anymore.  

:Developer Tools
The spreadsheet is titled CTCHECKLIST.XLS could be found in CTSTD module 
Ctchecklst.cfg can be found in CTSTD

:Best Practices
rules to changing Ctchecklist.xls
>Index number should be unique for each option. Never change it
>repace index number with keyword value, when we want to display options to the user
>change released version then change development version
>Each keyword shoud always have a value, "Y", "N", "D", do not hard code, set to "N" for not need or visible
>Categories of Tabs on Checklist Application reference from the document "Checlist User and Design Guide.doc"
>max tab number is 13
>text box are only permitted on the general tab
>special naming, two tab names can't changed(Injection Options, Injection B Options), General tab keywords can't change(_Injection_Type[n], _Injection_Name)

:Derived Keywords
>Add to the list of keyword that displayed in the checklist utility
DKINT, integer variable
DKSTR, string variable
DKBOOK, Boolean variable
>Add derived keyword to the following file, w:\pcbase\modulib\ctstd.954\"derived keywords definition.doc"
>writeable option should be set to "Y" to get user input for the keywords
>Writeable option should be set to ‘Y’ to get user input for the keywords.
>Rules for displaying keywords for a given product line should be set under ‘Display’ column.
>Set the last row in the ‘Keyword Display’ column to <ENDOFDATA>.
>Changes to the derived keywords are saved in the Ctchecklst.cfg file. 
>User input is assigned to the derived keywords through the function, assign_checklist_derived_keywords, which is found in the Checklist.c file.
>The keywords are processed when the function is called from the CTSTD.C file. 
>Processing order of the derived keywords is:
    CtStd
    Derived Keywords Tab via a call to assign_checklist_derived_keywords()
    CtDv – deviation modules
    CtSp – special modules
>As a result, settings in the derived keywords tab can be OVERWRITTEN by code in CTSP and CTDV modules. 
Switch to the derived keywords tab

:Keyword upgrade
>upgrade a chart from a previous release to the selected release
use command line, W:\PCBASE\Modulib\Checklst.018\checklist.exe /c CTSTD.946 /s _ed711 /cc
	018	This is the checklist application used by the target CtStd. This can be found in the CtStd directory, in the file, CtChecklst.cfg.
	946	This is the target CtStd.
	_ed711	This is the machine serial number.

    	Right-click “Tab Template”, 
    	Select “Move or Copy”, 
    	Check “Create a Copy” 
2.	Rename the worksheet appropriately.  
3.	Then, activate the “Tabs” tab and add an entry for the additional sheet to the list of tabs.  
4.	Type the display name of the tab in the “Tab” column and the sheet name in the “Sheet Name” column.  
5.	Finally, fill in all of the product line rules for this new tab.
;
>Add a new production line
1.	Add the new product line ID under the Display section for all of the tabs on the spreadsheet.
2.	Add the new product line under the Rules section for all of the tabs on the spreadsheet.
3.	Identify which keywords should be displayed from the “Keyword Display” section and then enter ‘Y’ or ‘N’ for product ID under “Display” section depending on the purpose of the [Display] as stated in Table.  
4.	Identify how the keywords/options will be selected by the user and then enter ‘Y’, ‘N’, or ‘D’ for product ID under “Rules” section according to [Rules] given in Table.
5.	Enter ‘Y’, ‘N’, or ‘D’ for product ID under “Rules” section for all the options in “Option Display” section. 
6.	Modify clsProductRules in the checklist Visual Basic project to include the new product line.

:Production system data flow #important production system architecture information#
Checklist application can be lauched as a standalone application. Many intermediate files are created by the production system. Two files are very important
Checklist.c and system.oit
>checklist.c, discribes the machine to the chart system
>system.oit, list the library modules from which machine data will be generated
>Production system Data flow
Prodction system data(machine databse, specials database, module library, configuration files)

:TroubleShooting
>Invalid procedure call or argument
keyword is not set to 'D', must display be set to 'N'
>New Option Value
Ctstd version changed from .030 to .031. Some warning of option value displayed
Cause, the index number has different display and keyword values in the two ctstd modules
Solution, each option should have same index number in all the ctstd modules
>Cann't enter in required value
Each combo box on the injection unit tabs requires that a default value is specified
