- Protocol hierarchy, the graph is taken from OSI model we most use in data networking today 

5 application layer: TCP{http, https, telnet, ssh, ftp, sftp, imap, pop3, smtp, dns}, UDP{dns, TFTP, DHCP}
4 transport layer: TCP, UDP 
3 network layer: IP(ICMP)
2 Data link layer: Wire{ethernet, serial, other}, Fiber{ethernet, ATM, other}, Wireless{ethernet, other}
1 Physical layer: wire, fiber, wireless

# Troubleshooting with Ping and Traceroute 
- Introduce internet control message protocol (ICMP)
    + RFC 792, ICMP 
    it's a layer three protocol 
    
    Frame header | IP header | ICMP information | FCS 
    
    + Reference other courses 
    introduction to networking in the CCNA series 
    
    + ICMP messages queries
    check if there is some resource avaliable 
    
        * two types of query, echo request, echo reply 
        
        we use ping utility 
        request number is 8 
        reply is 0 
        
        * time stamp request, time stamp reply 
        request number is 13 
        response is 14 
        
    + ICMP error messages 
    Destination unreachable, type 3, code 0 network unreachable 
                                     code 1 host unreachable 
                                     code 2 protocol unreachable 
                                     code 3 port unreachable 
                                     code 4-15 is uncommon, the device need to be checked 
    Redirect type 5, 
    Time exceeded type 11, indicate a routine loop, traceroute we can manipulate the TTCL to let us identify the device 
    
    TTL number means the max pass through router number 
    
    + deprecated experimental or unassigned ICMP messages , 1-2, 4, 6-7, 9-10, 12, 15-254
    
    this may means network attack 

- Traceroute utilities 
    + manipulates TTL value of package
    + triggers' time exceeded message from routers 
    
    + utility/application 
    + windows tracert 
    sends ICMP messages 
    
    + Mac/Linux traceroute 
    sends UDP messages 
    
    + traceroute is not always works as the ICMP message are not always works 
    
    normally firewall will not response to ICMP message 
    
- Demo: Examing proper ICMP 
    + open wireshark
    + add filter, icmp 
    
- Summary 
examined window and linux behavior of traceroute


# Troubleshooting with ICMP error message 


# Troubleshooting Dynamic host configuration protocol
- explain basic dhcp operation 
    + RFC 951, DHCP, BootP 
    + DHCP, RFC 1541 
    + DHCP, RFC 2131, current 
    
    + DHCP basic operation, DORA, four type of messages 
    DHCPDiscover message, layer 2, layer 3 as destination ip address 
    DHCPPOffer the server will response 
    DHCPRequest to the server to get ip from server 
    DHCPAck list of address is valid 
- Demo examine DHCP operation 
    + launch wireshark and plugin the wire 
    + the capture will list the DHCP communication messages 
    + add filter bootp 
    
    sometimes you may get a bad capture for DHCP capture 
    
    + in the DHCP package there will be some addtional information list the DHCP option settings 
- explain dhcp relay agent usage, a centralized DHCP server on your network 

- wireshark observe correct dhcp operation 


# troubleshooting domain name system (DNS) and slow networks 
- explain the basic DNS operation 
Romain names, RFC 1034 
DNS RFC 6195 
Clarifications to DNS, RFC 2181 
Dynamic Updates in DNS, RFC 2136 
DNS security RFC 4033, Dan Kaminsky discover a vulnerability of DNS
DNS(obsolete) RFC 2395 
- Does DNS use TCP or UDP? 
    + client request UDP resolve pluralsight.com and server could response 
    
    + client request with TCP 
    SYN >
    SYN-ACK <
    ACK > 
    resolve pluralsight.com 
    203.0.113.42 
    FIN-ACK >
    ACK <
    FIN-ACK <
    ACK >
    
    + server to server communication, they use TCP, the server use zone transfer, to make sure we don't lose any data 
    
    + client to server mostly use UDP 
    

- examine how web pages use DNS 
- Use wireshark to observe correct DNS operation 
    + use window 
    $ nslookup 
    will display the DNS name 
    
    www.pluralsight.com 
    
    DNS may distributed a resource with multiple IP 
    
    + use wireshark capture the traffic between nslookup 
    
    + microsoft automatic create teredo channel 
    
- use wireshark example slow web page 
    + example visit a site 
    
    download images, content 
    
    a advertising website www.adclick.com
    
    normally we will need resolve multiple urls 
    
    + first browser the webspage source and check 
    www.clker.comwww.pixabay.com 
    www.freeimageslive.com 
    staticflicker.com 
    + 


# TCP sequence and acknowledgment numbers 
- open wireshark
- make a incognito mode browser to make sure their is no cache 
- navigate to the website 
- start capture 
- build a quick filter with IP 
frame contains "www.veronicasplantrursery.com"

- select the message and right click the message 
Hypertext Transfer Protocol 

from the menu select Follow TCP Stream 

will display all the communication content for the aim TCP stream 

- The three way hand shake in TCP 
Sequence numbers and acknowledgment numbers 

Sequence number is used to identify a segment 

we can create acknowledgment base on sequence number, we can say remote send sequence 2 and we response acknowledgment received 2 

prevent hijack by TCP sequence attack randomized in transit for security. wireshark converts the randomized number to fixed values 

starts at 1 after 3 way handshake 

increments based on bytes in payload 

- sequence number operation 
the sender send a sequence number to the receiver the receiver will response a acknowledgment number plus with the next sequence number 

sender --<sequence number>[data]--------------------->receiver 
       <--<sequence number>[data size]<next sequence number>--
       
       
Bidirectional data transfer from two computer with the sequence number and acknowledgment number        

- Use wireshark to examine TCP sequence numbers 
    + capture local connection 
    + open incognito window 
    + navigate to a website 
    + download a file 
    + find the website address 
    $ ping url 
    
    go back and create filter to that IP 
    
    ip.addr == <website IP> 
    
- when we saw some information in wireshark panel which is bracketed which means it is wireshark interpreted by wireshark such as the sequence number which randomized in real TCP data     
    
- sequence number and acknowledgment number are all numbered with bytes 

- the maximized TCP segment data size is 1460 

- maximum transmission unit (MTU) vs maximum segment size (MSS)

Frame header(14 bytes) | Maximum Transmission Unit(MTU) = 1500 bytes 

MTU = IP Header + Max IP Payload 

IP Header is 20 bytes, so the data 

MAXIMUM total frame size is 1514 bytes 

the window size could be negotiate between client and server to improve the communication performance 

- Use wireshark to observe package loss 
    + package loss 
    
    TCP Dup ACK status will means network issue which is captured by wireshark
