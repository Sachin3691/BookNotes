Introduction to Troubleshooting and Protocol Analysis=Ross Bagurdes;Note=Erxin

# Introduction
- Logical approach 
    + gather and evaluate information 
    + guess hypothesis 
    + Collect evidence 
    + Create a plan and test 
    
- Derailing logic 
user
managers 
coworkers 
- Quality wireshark troubleshooting
    + understand protocol operation
    + understand diagnostic utility operation 
    + interpret wireshark output 
    + use information to support a hypothesis 
    
- wireshark protocol analysis 
    + interpreting ping, traceroute, and ICMP 
    + DHCP, proper and improper operation 
    + DNS, basic operation and slow networks 
    + TCP sequence and acknowledgement numbers, isolate slow network, how TCP works beyond the three way handshake 
    
- Protocol hierarchy, the graph is taken from OSI model we most use in data networking today 

5 application layer: TCP{http, https, telnet, ssh, ftp, sftp, imap, pop3, smtp, dns}, UDP{dns, TFTP, DHCP}
4 transport layer: TCP, UDP 
3 network layer: IP(ICMP)
2 Data link layer: Wire{ethernet, serial, other}, Fiber{ethernet, ATM, other}, Wireless{ethernet, other}
1 Physical layer: wire, fiber, wireless

# Troubleshooting with Ping and Traceroute 
- Introduce internet control message protocol (ICMP)
    + RFC 792, ICMP 
    it's a layer three protocol 
    
    Frame header | IP header | ICMP information | FCS 
    
    + Reference other courses 
    introduction to networking in the CCNA series 
    
    + ICMP messages queries
    check if there is some resource avaliable 
    
        * two types of query, echo request, echo reply 
        
        we use ping utility 
        request number is 8 
        reply is 0 
        
        * time stamp request, time stamp reply 
        request number is 13 
        response is 14 
        
    + ICMP error messages 
    Destination unreachable, type 3, code 0 network unreachable 
                                     code 1 host unreachable 
                                     code 2 protocol unreachable 
                                     code 3 port unreachable 
                                     code 4-15 is uncommon, the device need to be checked 
    Redirect type 5, 
    Time exceeded type 11, indicate a routine loop, traceroute we can manipulate the TTCL to let us identify the device 
    
    TTL number means the max pass through router number 
    
    + deprecated experimental or unassigned ICMP messages , 1-2, 4, 6-7, 9-10, 12, 15-254
    
    this may means network attack 

- Traceroute utilities 
    + manipulates TTL value of package
    + triggers' time exceeded message from routers 
    
    + utility/application 
    + windows tracert 
    sends ICMP messages 
    
    + Mac/Linux traceroute 
    sends UDP messages 
    
    + traceroute is not always works as the ICMP message are not always works 
    
    normally firewall will not response to ICMP message 
    
- Demo: Examing proper ICMP 
    + open wireshark
    + add filter, icmp 
    
- Summary 
examined window and linux behavior of traceroute


# Troubleshooting with ICMP error message 


# Troubleshooting Dynamic host configuration protocol
- explain basic dhcp operation 
    + RFC 951, DHCP, BootP 
    + DHCP, RFC 1541 
    + DHCP, RFC 2131, current 
    
    + DHCP basic operation, DORA, four type of messages 
    DHCPDiscover message, layer 2, layer 3 as destination ip address 
    DHCPPOffer the server will response 
    DHCPRequest to the server to get ip from server 
    DHCPAck list of address is valid 
- Demo examine DHCP operation 
    + lauch wireshark and plugin the wire 
    + the capture will list the DHCP communication messages 
    + add filter bootp 
    
    sometimes you may get a bad capture for DHCP capture 
    
    + in the DHCP package there will be some addtional information list the DHCP option settings 
- explain dhcp relay agent usage, a centralized DHCP server on your network 

- wireshark observe correct dhcp operation 


# troubleshooting domain name system (DNS) and slow networks 
- explain the basic DNS operation 
Romain names, RFC 1034 
DNS RFC 6195 
Clarifications to DNS, RFC 2181 
Dynamic Updates in DNS, RFC 2136 
DNS security RFC 4033, Dan Kaminsky discover a vulnerability of DNS
DNS(obsolete) RFC 2395 
- Does DNS use TCP or UDP? 
    + client request UDP resolve pluralsight.com and server could response 
    
    + client request with TCP 
    SYN >
    SYN-ACK <
    ACK > 
    resolve pluralsight.com 
    203.0.113.42 
    FIN-ACK >
    ACK <
    FIN-ACK <
    ACK >
    
    + server to server communcation, they use TCP, the server use zone transfer, to make sure we don't lose any data 
    
    + client to server mostly use UDP 
    

- examine how web pages use DNS 
- Use wireshark to observe correct DNS operation 
    + use window 
    $ nslookup 
    will display the DNS name 
    
    www.pluralsight.com 
    
    DNS may distributed a resource with multiple IP 
    
    + use wireshark capture the traffic between nslookup 
    
    + microsoft automatic create teredo channel 
    
- use wireshark example slow web page 
    + example visit a site 
    
    download images, content 
    
    a advertising website www.adclick.com
    
    normally we will need resolve multiple urls 
    
    + first browser the webspage source and check
