normally NIC card discard the messages which not match the mac address, if your need to capture the packets for all the network you need to set your NIC card to promiscuous mode to allow wireshark to capture all packets on the interface 

- how to use wireshark
    + install wireshark
    + workstation connected to the network and configure NIC card to promiscuous
    
- understand wireshark 
    + what wireshark does 
    captures traffic on any network interface 
    provides tools for analyzing this data 
    
    + what wireshark does not do 
    does not inject traffic into the network 
    
    does not take action based on the network traffic, the exception is name resolution 
    
    if you use wireshark network performance you would like to turn of name resolution for wireshark to prevent it influence the performance measurement 
    
    + interpretation and display packet 
    + search packet between packet 
    + filter traffic base on some pattern 
    + colorization for some specific packet
    + reports analyze the traffic for you 
    + save, import and export 
    
- Install for window 
- Install for mac 
- When to use wireshark
    + IT professional 
    + network administrator and engineers 
    + Developer 
    + network security engineer 
    
    + analyzing network traffic 
    detect errors, multiple retry packets
    troubleshoot performance problem 
    troubleshoot network error, network equipment error 
    reconstruct events 
    understand network traffic 
    policy infractions, most organization have policy, analyze to see if it is policy infractions
    
    + packet analysis, protocol analysis, network analysis with wireshark analysis
    
    + over 850 protocols supported 
    http, https 
    tcp/udp 
    ipv4, ipv6 
    ethernet, wifi 
    tip, nhp, odpg 
    icmp 
    ipsec protocols 
    
    + protocol dissector 
    dissect a specific protocol and labels the individual fields for display in wireshark
    
    + look for normal and abnormal traffic patterns 
    look basis of comparison 
    abnormal, what doesn't match the baseline? 
- Demo
    + understand wireshark installation folder 
    + open the app 
    + click wireshark help menu 
    + click about and check the folder tabs 
    + in the wireshark installation folder there are several tools installed with wireshark 
    + the personal configuration is the configuration folder which your configuration with be saved. The profile could be shared with other team to share the configuration  
    + keyboard shortcut 
    
- Privacy and security
    + wiretap act
    + electronic communicators privacy act ECPA 
    + exceptions you need to get proof before start sniff 
    
    + network packet captures may contain 
    company information 
    network and system configuration details 
    security credentials 
    personal information 
    
    + secure your packet captures 
    network traffic has value 
    intellectual property 
    mission critical traffic 
    get permission first some companies have policies that explicitly bar the use of packet scanners 

- Best practices
know and follow policy 
interpersonal traffic 
escalation procedures 
ensure you have approval 
work within agreed-upon 
set your clock to accurate time, meaningful time stamps on packet to sync with time server 
have a plan 
    + why are you sniffing 
    + what you can and cannot sniff 
    + how you will secure your captures 
    + what are your baseline measurements 


# Capturing network traffic with wireshark
- introduction 
    + live packet capture and display packet 
    + look at the traffic being sent to and from your computer 
- topics covered 
    + connecting wireshark to the network 
    + review of the OSI model 
    + best practices and nextsteps 

- connecting wireshark to the network
    + get a map of your network 
    + where to capture depends what you want to capture, you have to identify the traffic path 
    
    roundtrips servers 
    
    + guideline, start as close as possible the problem is occurring 
    
    if not sure where problems is capture traffic multiple places 
    
    + how to connect to the network 
    install on the wireshark on the computer you want to troubleshoot
        * advantage 
        not network changes 
        * disadvantage 
        may impact performance 
        does not scale 
        
    insert a network tab, is piece of hardware to enable capture traffic 
        * advantage
        does not impede the traffic 
        sees all traffic on a wire 
        
        * disadvantage 
        connection broken where installed 
        does not scale 

    connect via a hub in the middle, the hub will broadcast all the traffic 
        * advantage 
        simple 
        see all traffic on network segment 
        
        * may insert traffic into the network 
        slows network traffic 
        
        you may insert traffic into network, will slow network down 
        
    mirror port on the switch  
        * advantage
        captures all traffic in and out of the specific switch port 
        
        * disadvantage 
        require a port to be available on the switch 
        consumes switch recourse 
        need to configure switch port 
        potential for dropped packets, if the switch doesn't support fast enough transformation. mirror port double the network load for the specific port 
        
- capture live network traffic 
    + capture local network with wireshark
    + will list all the available 
    + Capture > Options 
    all the input device could be checked in the table 
    
    if doesn't list all the device then try run as administrator
        
    + double click a device in the start up page to capture the packets for the device 
        
    + right click the down packet view will show relative content menu 
    
- Review of the OSI model 
    + over 850 protocols supported 
    AppletTalk 
    LANs 
    Mobile telephony 
    Sensor IoT 
    SIGTRAN 
    TCP/IP 
    
    + wireshark uses layer approach to display each protocol 
    Layer 7, Application layer 
    Layer 6, Presentation Layer 
    Layer 5, Session Layer 
    Layer 4, Transport Layer 
    Layer 3, Network Layer 
    Layer 2, Data link Layer 
    Layer 1, Physical Layer 
    
    + the info column will display application data for application layer 
    
    + wireshark will not expose physical layer 
    + encapsulation packet
    layer 7& 6 payload 
    layer 7& 6 payload |layer 5 |session 
    layer 7& 6 payload |layer 5 session| layer 4 transport
    layer 7& 6 payload |layer 5 session| layer 4 transport|layer 3 network 
    layer 7& 6 payload |layer 5 session| layer 4 transport|layer 3 network |layer 2 data link 
    layer 7& 6 payload |layer 5 session| layer 4 transport|layer 3 network |layer 2 data link |layer 1 physical
    
    + in the packet list window which is the top pane in wireshark main window. The column Protocol column will display the highest layer which wireshark be able to interpret 
        
- Navigate your packet capture 
    + navigation a packet capture with wireshark
    + click apply filter which is above the packet list window 
    
    + use shortcut to easy your life 
    shift+arrow to expand a item 
    ctrl+arrow to expand all items 
    tab/shift tab to navigate between pane 
    
- Explore the wireshark GUI 
    + Edit > Preferences 
    change the Appearance>Layout to change the default layout and columns 
        
    + if do not want to see the content of packet(hex window) just drag down the frame. to display it just drag the bottom frame again 
        
- Mark, save and export your packets 
    + right click a packet we could mark it in the context menu 
    
    + save and export, we could export packet base on marks, selected, range etc 
    + we could also ignore packets, the packet will be gray out 
    
- Best practices 
    + capture as less as possible, 64 mega bytes per second will be generated in some of the protocl 
    + create a network map 
    physical inventory first 
    digital inventory 
    identity network node address 
    
    + four different options to capture traffic 
    avoid impacting the live network traffic 
    port mirroring on the switch 
    full duplex tap, on the network link 
    avoid getting sidetracked 
    
    + maintain a healthy skepticism 
    bytes pane, bits in the packets 
    
    packet details pane -> wireshark's interpretation  of the bits 
    
    + most specifications describe the individual fields and their purpose 
    
        * example 
        google, ietf ip sepcification will display the original specification 
        
        search the header format will defined the fields of the ip header 
        
    + if you find a bug in 
    https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/ 
    
    + check samples 
    https://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures 
    
    + learn the protocols you need to investigate check the specifications 
    
    
    
# Filtering live network traffic with wireshark
- Capture filter 
- modify and rename existing filter is a easy way to create a filter 
- capturing intermittent problems 
- setting up ring buffers 
- turning name resolution on and off 
- what's is a capture filter? 
    + applied while capturing the traffic 
    
    filtering a live traffic which called captured filter 
    
    + applied after capturing the traffic 
    
    it is a display filter 
    
- why use a capture filter 
    + limits size of the capture 
    + improve performance 
    + focus on desired traffic 
    
- capture filter syntax 
    + syntax defines how to write words to create well-formed sentences 
    + filter syntax, defines search criteria to support effective searches 
    
- plan before starting the capture 
hostname 
netwokr address 
ip 
port numbers 
direction(src), destination(dst)
source and destination together 
protocols, such as ARP 
Ether net
IP 
TCP only 
UDP 
WLAN, select wireless LAN only 

- filter is a expression 
Protocol + direction + type, the rules could be combined with logic operations 

TCP destination host 

    + complex example 
TCP dst Port 80 and Port 443 

- apply a capture filter in the filter input box 
    + open wireshark 
    + select a device 
    + enter the above filter syntax in the filter input box 
    
- apply a filter, Capture > Options or click the icon in the toolbar icon like a gear cog. will open the Capture interfaces dialog box 
    
in the input tab column, we could add different filter for different devices

- modify an existing capture filter
