normally NIC card discard the messages which not match the mac address, if your need to capture the packets for all the network you need to set your NIC card to promiscuous mode to allow wireshark to capture all packets on the interface 

- how to use wireshark
    + install wireshark
    + workstation connected to the network and configure NIC card to promiscuous
    
- understand wireshark 
    + what wireshark does 
    captures traffic on any network interface 
    provides tools for analyzing this data 
    
    + what wireshark does not do 
    does not inject traffic into the network 
    
    does not take action based on the network traffic, the exception is name resolution 
    
    if you use wireshark network performance you would like to turn of name resolution for wireshark to prevent it influence the performance measurement 
    
    + interpretation and display packet 
    + search packet between packet 
    + filter traffic base on some pattern 
    + colorization for some specific packet
    + reports analyze the traffic for you 
    + save, import and export

    + keyboard shortcut 
    
- Privacy and security
    + wiretap act
    + electronic communicators privacy act ECPA 
    + exceptions you need to get proof before start sniff 
    
    + network packet captures may contain 
    company information 
    network and system configuration details 
    security credentials 
    personal information 
    
    + secure your packet captures 
    network traffic has value 
    intellectual property 
    mission critical traffic 
    get permission first some companies have policies that explicitly bar the use of packet scanners 

- Best practices
know and follow policy 
interpersonal traffic 
escalation procedures 
ensure you have approval 
work within agreed-upon 
set your clock to accurate time, meaningful time stamps on packet to sync with time server 
have a plan 
    + why are you sniffing 
    + what you can and cannot sniff 
    + how you will secure your captures 
    + what are your baseline measurements 


# Capturing network traffic with wireshark
- introduction 
    + live packet capture and display packet 
    + look at the traffic being sent to and from your computer 
- topics covered 
    + connecting wireshark to the network 
    + review of the OSI model 
    + best practices and nextsteps 

- connecting wireshark to the network
    + get a map of your network 
    + where to capture depends what you want to capture, you have to identify the traffic path 
    
    roundtrips servers 
    
    + guideline, start as close as possible the problem is occurring 
    
    if not sure where problems is capture traffic multiple places 
    
    + how to connect to the network 
    install on the wireshark on the computer you want to troubleshoot
        * advantage 
        not network changes 
        * disadvantage 
        may impact performance 
        does not scale 
        
    insert a network tab, is piece of hardware to enable capture traffic 
        * advantage
        does not impede the traffic 
        sees all traffic on a wire 
        
        * disadvantage 
        connection broken where installed 
        does not scale 

    connect via a hub in the middle, the hub will broadcast all the traffic 
        * advantage 
        simple 
        see all traffic on network segment 
        
        * may insert traffic into the network 
        slows network traffic 
        
        you may insert traffic into network, will slow network down 
        
    mirror port on the switch  
        * advantage
        captures all traffic in and out of the specific switch port 
        
        * disadvantage 
        require a port to be available on the switch 
        consumes switch recourse 
        need to configure switch port 
        potential for dropped packets, if the switch doesn't support fast enough transformation. mirror port double the network load for the specific port 
        
- capture live network traffic 
    + capture local network with wireshark
    + will list all the available 
    + Capture > Options 
    all the input device could be checked in the table 
    
    if doesn't list all the device then try run as administrator

- Explore the wireshark GUI 
    + Edit > Preferences 
    change the Appearance>Layout to change the default layout and columns 
        
    + if do not want to see the content of packet(hex window) just drag down the frame. to display it just drag the bottom frame again 
        
- Mark, save and export your packets 
    + right click a packet we could mark it in the context menu 
    
    + save and export, we could export packet base on marks, selected, range etc 
    + we could also ignore packets, the packet will be gray out 
    
- Best practices 
    + capture as less as possible, 64 mega bytes per second will be generated in some of the protocol 
    + create a network map 
    physical inventory first 
    digital inventory 
    identity network node address 
    
    + four different options to capture traffic 
    avoid impacting the live network traffic 
    port mirroring on the switch

# Filtering live network traffic with wireshark
- Capture filter 
- modify and rename existing filter is a easy way to create a filter 
- capturing intermittent problems 
- setting up ring buffers 
- turning name resolution on and off 
- what's is a capture filter? 
    + applied while capturing the traffic 
    
    filtering a live traffic which called captured filter 
    
    + applied after capturing the traffic 
    
    it is a display filter 
    
- why use a capture filter 
    + limits size of the capture 
    + improve performance 
    + focus on desired traffic 
    
- capture filter syntax 
    + syntax defines how to write words to create well-formed sentences 
    + filter syntax, defines search criteria to support effective searches 
    
- plan before starting the capture 
hostname 
network address 
ip 
port numbers 
direction(src), destination(dst)
source and destination together 
protocols, such as ARP 
Ether net
IP 
TCP only 
UDP 
WLAN, select wireless LAN only 

- filter is a expression 
Protocol + direction + type, the rules could be combined with logic operations 

TCP destination host 

    + complex example 
TCP dst Port 80 and Port 443 

- apply a capture filter in the filter input box 
    + open wireshark 
    + select a device 
    + enter the above filter syntax in the filter input box 
    
- apply a filter, Capture > Options or click the icon in the toolbar icon like a gear cog. will open the Capture interfaces dialog box 
    
in the input tab column, we could add different filter for different devices

- modify an existing capture filter 
    + Capture > Capture Filters 
    there are built in 50+ filters defined in the wireshark
    
    + click copy icon in below and rename it 
    
    + search the specification from 
    http://www.iana.org/assignment/iee-802-numbers/ieee-802-numbers.xhtml
    
    search the IEEE 802 numbers create a filter base on Ethernet type 0x0806 (ARP) filter 
    
    search 802 number for 802.1x and copy the control number 888E and replace the value(0x0805) for the 0x0806 filter 
    
    + the filters will be saved for future used 
    
- using ring buffers to capture, capturing intermittent problems 
    + live scenario, connection problem only happen one floor occasionally 
    
    need to capture network for an undetermined amount of time 
    
    + use ring buffer, like circle logs 
    
    + click the gear icon in the toolbar and select a capture interface below in the input tab 
    
    and select output tab and select use a ring buffer and set the file size 
    
- impact of name resolution, address resolution 
    + is name resolution will impact the capture? 
    + name resolution is supported at multiple layers 
    ethernet mac layer, cisc
    ip network layer, use DNS 
    TCP/UDP port number transport layer 
    VLAN tag id 
    
    + resolved names are not stored, when you open capture files on different computer, the captured computer name may changed 
    
    + injects traffic into the network, when you measure network performance we need to avoid enable name resolution
    
    | name resolution fails often
    
    + impact wireshark performance, wireshark may wait for the dns server to response 

- turning name resolution on and off for mac, ip and tcp/udp port numbers 

select the ethernet interface in the packet capture window 

expand the ethernet row for the captured name. The source and destination are display the address or resolved names 

    + Edit > Preferences > Name resolution 
    enable or disable the name resolution 
    
    we can configure 
    resolve mac address 
    resolve transport names 
    resolve network(ip) address 
    etc 
    
    + resolved name are not saved in the captured name. 
    
- best practices and action plan 
    + right click the captured row select Protocol Preferences > Validate the IPv4 checksum if possible 
    
    uncheck the checkbox 
    
    + make sure you actually have connectivity 
    + not sure then capture everything 
    + turn off name resolution 
    + troubleshooting intermittent problems use ring buffers 
    + identify capture filters that would help you focus on specific aspects of your job function 
    
    identify traffic that you need to capture 
    
    + turn name resolution on and observer the impact 
    did it successfully resolve the names 
    did you notice performance changes

# Using display filters 
- what is a display filter 
    + wireshark have two different filter 
    capture traffic 
    display filter which applied after capturing the traiffc 
    
    + why use a display filter, keep all packets just filter out the desire packets 
    
    extensive search options 
    
    no data loss 
    
- display filter syntax which is different from capture filter. It also use coloring rules 
    + protocols, wireshark support over 2000 protocols 
    + protocol fields 
    + syntax, example as a IP protocol 
    
    Protocol <string> relation  value 
    
    original RFC: 791 which describe the internet protocol, the IP header. 
    
        * example let's filter out the destination IP 
    IP dst == 10.0.0.10 
    
        * relation operators 
    eq == 
    ne != 
    gt > 
    lt < 
    ge >= 
    le =< 
    
        + conditions 
    is present 
    contains 
    matches 
    
        + example 
        tcp.port == 80 and ip.addr == 10.10.10.1 
        
    + save the filter result in the toolbar 
    + adding and removing filters from the toolbar to reduce complexity 
    
    click the plus in the toolbar which on the right side of the filter bar 
    
    we could also add the filter button in the preference filter expression settings 
    
    + different way to create a display filter 
        * modify a existing display filter 
        * click the bookmark icon on the left side of the filter bar and select the manage the display filter 
        
        we could copy a existing filter and modify them, select a filter we could remove it 
        
- When you close wireshark some of the information is kept and some of them is not 
    + kept 
    packet length 
    packets bits 
    timestamp 
    
    + not kept 
    current display filter unless you save the display filter 
    packet markings 
    time reference 
    name resolution information 
    
    + express allow you to compare values in protocols fields carried in a packet 
    
    + working with expression to create display filter 
    click the expression button on the right filter bar 
    will give a list of protocols which wireshark supported, we could 
   
    it is a tool to help us create complex filters 
    
    + amazingly useful shortcut, done a capture on a wifi 
    select a data in the packect capture data 
    open the context menu and choose select as packet filter 
    we could also choose the operators when apply the value 
    
    
- best practices and next steps, use display filters when you need to 
learn
analyze
troubleshoot 

    + focus on the protocols fields that are important to your job function

# Setup the capture for wireshark 
- reference 
https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup

- guide 
    1. are you allowed to do this ?
    2. General help 
    3. Capture traffic "sent to" and "sent from" your local machines 
    
Troubleshooting:

/NetworkInterfaces - make sure that you've selected the right interface

/NetworkMedia - there might be network media (/Ethernet, /PPP, ...) specific limitations

Promiscuous mode - try both on or off, whatever works

/InterferingSoftware - low level networking software (e.g. VPN / (personal) firewall software) may cause trouble

/Offloading - how your NIC might skew your capture

no traffic - make sure you don't capture on a "silent" network with no traffic on it ;-) (if you really don't have any traffic: using an internet radio is a simple traffic generator)

Performance - what you can do if packet drops occur
    
    + Capture traffic destined from machines other than your own 
Make sure you capture from a location in the network where all relevant traffic will pass through:

/NetworkTopology - choose the right place in your network topology in order to get the required network traffic.

/NetworkMedia - there might be network media (/Ethernet, /PPP, ...) specific limitations

Promiscuous mode - must be switched on (this may not work with some WLAN cards on Win32!)

- capture traffic using a remote machine 
/Pipes - using a UNIX pipe and use a different tool to capture from

/WinPcapRemote - using [WinPcap]'s remote capturing feature (rpcapd)

RMON - use SNMP's RMON to capture - currently not supported ("Remote Packet Capture Using RMON" explains why it doesn't work well)

- check the reference links for capture other protocol types

    can negatively impact the performance of wireshark 
    
    + apply coloring rules 
    coloring rules are like ACLs 
    rules are applied from top to bottom 
    once a rule is applied the following rules are ignored 
    
    + the coloring rules could be export to a file 
    
    the saved file contain all the existing coloring rules, each line standard for a single coloring rules 
    
    the exclamation marks in the front means the rule is disabled 
- Demo 
- working with coloring rules 
    + what you can color 
    packets 
    conversations, flow of packets between two endpoints, colored conversations will color all packets between tow endpoints such as    
        * TCP 
        * UDP 
        * IP 
        * Ethernet 
        these will track a conversation between client and DHTP server

- remove all the temporary coloring rule by Control+Spacebar or 

View > Colorize Conversation > Reset Colorization 

- best practices and action plan 
    + agree a coloring scheme to use in your organization
    
    the purpose of a coloring is used to assistance you identify the packet 
    
    soft colors for information 
    bright or deep colors to highlight packets 
    
    + put the more detailed coloring rules first 
    
    + use contrast between text and the background colors 

    + restrain yourself from using too much color and it will slow wireshark down
