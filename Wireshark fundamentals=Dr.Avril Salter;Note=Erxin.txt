# Getting started with wireshark 
- purpose of this module 
- get you up and running with wireshark
    + foundation, labs 
    + what is wireshark
    + privacy and security consideration 
    + best practices and action plan 
    + discover "about wireshark"
    
- what is wireshark, application trace the network traffic, one of the best open source packet 

open 

free 

industry collaboration 

works on major os 

1997 Gerald Combs created Ethereal > now changed name to wireshark

currently built on QT platform 

- network packet analyzer 
TCP/UDP 
IP
LLC 
MAC
PHY 

Browser, etc... applications 

- let OS enable the catch the traffic by a driver

normally NIC card discard the messages which not match the mac address, if your need to capture the packets for all the network you need to set your NIC card to promiscuous mode to allow wireshark to capture all packets on the interface 

- how to use wireshark
    + install wireshark
    + workstation connected to the network and configure NIC card to promiscuous
    
- understand wireshark 
    + what wireshark does 
    captures traffic on any network interface 
    provides tools for analyzing this data 
    
    + what wireshark does not do 
    does not inject traffic into the network 
    
    does not take action based on the network traffic, the exception is name resolution 
    
    if you use wireshark network performance you would like to turn of name resolution for wireshark to prevent it influence the performance measurement 
    
    + interpretation and display packet 
    + search packet between packet 
    + filter traffic base on some pattern 
    + colorization for some specific packet
    + reports analyze the traffic for you 
    + save, import and export
