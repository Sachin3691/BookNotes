Introduction to Firewalls=Ross Bagurdes;Note=Erxin

# Course overview 
- Why need firewall
- DMZ 
- TCP state table 
- tcp three way handshake 
- reference causes 
    + CCNA cisco certifcate cause 
    + wireshark cause 
    
- module goals 
    + why need 
    + what is firewall 
    + zones and polices 
    + desired firewall 
    + tcp state table 


# Introduction
- threat avoidance/detection systems 
- AAA/ID management, AAA authentication authorization and accounting, validate user access and deny access 
- intrusion detection system IDS 
- URL filter, stop user access from pornography
- virus scanner 
- logging and take logging from all devices 


# What is this firwall doing 
- untrusted outside/public 
- trusted inside/local network 
- identify the trustworthness of a network 
inside/internal or lan 
outside/internet or wan 
other networks, DMZ or perimeter 
- security policy 
identifies traffic flow 
trusted to untrusted 
untrusted to trusted 

applies permit/deny rules to flow 
applies other rules to traffic 
diffcult traffic ftp. h.323 

- desired firewall behavior 
inside PC --trusted zone---cisco firewall ---untrusted zone---web

    + tcp state table 
source ip:port          destination:port        state 
192.168.10.10:53510     172.25.10.100:80        SYN Sent 

if the outside server reply sync apk and the previous client state syn sent then the message will be allow and the client will send syn ack and then the tcp state of the row will be mark as establishsed 

- access rules and their expected 
when our server exposed to untrusted zone then we need add rules to support access the server 
- demo

# Network address translation (NAT)
- translate from private network address to public address 
- dynamic nat 
- static nat 
- port address translation(PAT), allow lots of internal devices share a single public address 

- history of NAT 
1981, 32 bit ip address classful allocation 

NAT required IPv4 very limited 

nat boundary will automatic switch private ip to public ip 

manipulate the IP packet header 

manipulate the TCP segment header, source port destination port 

    + relevant for NAT
source ip address, destination ip address 
source port number, destination port number 

    + socket 
    source ip address: source port number 
    destination ip address: destination port number 

- local vs global 
local                           global                     
private addression typ)         public addressing 
inside/trusted                  outside/untrusted 

local and global is defined by which device NAT is talking about 

    + when NAT in action and hit the firewall 
    
NAT table
inside local  outside local     inside global  outside global 
ip:port         ip:port             ip:port 
10..0.0.10:56487  203.0.113.100:80   198.51.100.10 203.0.133.100:80

for pure TCP firewall keep the source destination table for inside and global 

for NAT the firewall have to keep the NAT translation table 

- how static NAT works 
statically set the global address and the local address so that users on the outside of our network in our global side of our network 

- how dynamic port address address translation(PAT/NAT with overload/dynamic NAT/dynamic PAT) 

add dynamic port for the NAT transformation table, then mapping could be established between multiple client outside with a single public IP 


# The DMZ, demilitarized zone 
- the need for the DMZ 
    + move the internal public webserver to a special IP zoon in firewall 
    
    inside web server 192.168.42.80/24 DMZ 
    
    DMZ is some place between trusted and untrusted zoon in network 
    
    the inside webserver normally can access inside PC except set by a explicit access rule 
- DMZ operation 
- Demonstrate configuring a DMZ 


# Non-TCP Protocols 
- TCP state table and ICMP 
- other non-TCP protocols 
- new state 
- by default firewall will automatic block icmp message which used by ping 

this is due to ICMP message don't have the port information and can't be added into the mapping table of firewall

firewall will let it continue but the response will not be allowed pass through the firewall 

this also happened for UDP message 

- create a state table for none TCP message for resolve the previous issue to allow these kinds of message pass through firewall 

for example TFTP, trivial file transfer protocol which used udp 

after setting the state table the port for the non-tcp protcol could be recorded, the most udp based protocols will change the port unpredictable between the firewall 


# Next generation firewalls 
- application awareness 
    + firewall can tell the difference between the message send by different content and users 
    
    + different application send from HTTP instead of network browser will also be blocked. The firewall known the messages send by these applications are not from browsers 
- user control
    + control accessibility by different user roles 
- stateful firewall
