# Part 1 Get start 
- explore the interface 
introduce ribbon toolbar 
group view 
task view 
quick access status bar 

- Gantt Chart timescale, you can adjust this timescale by using the Timescale command on the View tab or the Zoom Slider on the status bar in the lower right corner 


# Simple scheduling basics 
- Create new project and open the Project Information panel from the Project tab 
- Configure the project start time and select the Calender for the project. We could also customize the calender 
    + add Exception for the calender for additional working day or vacation 
    
- Enter the plan and title and other property from the project property dialog 

File|Info|Project Information | Advanced Properties 

    + properties 
    subject 
    manager 
    company 
    comments 
    
- build a task list 
    + add a task 
    + task enable scheduled by manual or automatic 
    + configure task and scheduled time by Project Options panel 
    hours per day 
    days per month 
    start and end working time 
    use abbreviation to standard for working time, 30m, 2h, 3d, 3w, 2mo (months)
    
    +  task’s duration, precede the duration abbreviation with an e. For example, enter 1ed to indicate one full 24-hour day, or 1ew to equal seven 24-hour days, or 1emo to equal thirty 24-hour days.
    
    + milestone tasks, significant events 
    
        * insert milestone task

        Task | Properties | Information| Advanced | Mark Task as Milestone 
        
    + group tasks into several summary tasks 
        * top to bottom planning 
        * bottom up planning 
    
    + link tasks two tasks can have one of only four types of task relationships, as described in the following table.
    Finish - Start 
    Start - Finish

    + assign work resource to tasks 
    Duration × Assignment Units = Work
    
    24 hours (that’s three 8-hour days) task duration × 200% (for two resources) assignment units = 48 hours of total work
    
    + Another quick way to assign resources is to use the Resource Names column

- Format and share your plan 
    +  SimpleFormat practice file from the Project2019SBS\Ch07 folder
    + Gantt chart is the most common visualization of a project’s schedule or plan
    + On the File tab, click Options. In the Project Options dialog box, click General. I

- Track progress: basic techniques 
    + progress tracking 
    are tasks starting and finishing as planned? 
    
    are resources spending more or less time than planned to complete tasks?
    
    when planning similar projects in the future, will you be able to determine how good your estimation skill? 
    
    + update task 
    percentage 
    start, end time 
    
    + save a baseline of your plan, project support up to 11 baselines in a single plan. After few development time we could use these baseline compare the current development schedule 

    + Save a base line 
    Project | Schedule | Set Baseline 

    we could also clear a previous saved baseline 
    
    + Use the Variance table to check the baseline and the schedual 
    View | Task Views | Other Views | Task Sheet 
    
    View | Data | Tables | Variance

    + record work as scheduled 
    Project | Status | Update Project 
    
    + update task completion percentage

    add percent completion column 
    
    enter percentage value from task information dialog 
    
    use mouse to set progress on Gantt bars 
    
    + record a task's actual values in teh Tracking table 
    View | Data | Tables | Tracking 
    
    Task | Schedule | Mark on Track | Update Tasks 

    Project marks the task as completed and extends the Gantt bar of the task to indicate its longer duration. You can see the results of this by viewing change highlighting


# Advanced scheduling techniques 
- Fine-tune task scheduling 
    + check task relation ships by using task path. Turn on task path predecessors 
    Format | Bar Styles | Task Path 
    
    + Adjust task link relationships 
    Finish to start, FS 
    
    Start to Start, SS 
    
    Finish to finish, FF
    
    Start to finish, SF 
    
    + you enter a 1-day lag between tasks 1 and 2
    
    From the Task Table | Predecessor Column enter, # + delay time, such as 1 day 
    
    + To add lead or lag time between linked tasks 
    Double click a task or from the Task Information dialog box, in the Lag field enter the time (-2d, or 2d)
    
    + Constraints fall into three categories 
    
        * Flexible constraints, Flexible constraints Project can change the start and finish dates of a task. ASAP is the default constraint. 
        
        * Semi-flexible constraints, a task has a start or finish date boundary. Project displays a special constraint indicator
        
        * Inflexible constraints, a task must begin or end on a certain date.
    
        * constraint table 
        Constraint Categories       Constraint Types 
        Flexible                    ASAP 
        Flexible                    ALAP, as late as possible 
        Semi-flexible               SNET, start no earlier than 
        Semi-flexible               SNLT, start no late than 
        Semi-flexible               FNET, finish no earlier than 
        Semi-flexible               FNLT, finish no later than 
        Inflexible                  MSO, Must start on 
        Inflexible                  MFO, Must finish on 
    
    + Apply a task constraint  Task | Properties | Information | Advanced | Constraint Type 
    
    select the constraint type you want 
    
    + Interrupt work on a task, there is a split task button in the toolbar to let user drag and drop to split a existing task 
    
    On the Task tab, in the Schedule group, click the Split Task button
    
    Each segment of the task can be rescheduled 
    
    + Adjust working time for individual tasks 
    
    Project | Properties | Change Working Time | Create New Calendar 
    
    we could modify the Exception and Work Sheet 
    
    + Control task scheduling by using task types 
    
    The default task type is fixed units: If you change a task’s duration, Project recalculates work.
    
    Two other types, fixed duration, fixed work 
    
    Task | Properties | Information | Advanced | Task Type 

    + Display schedule details of a task in the task inspector pane

    End The entire fixed cost is scheduled for the end of the task. 
    
    Prorated (default accrual method) The fixed cost is distributed evenly over the duration of the task.
    
    + Enter a fixed cost amount and accrual method 
    View | Task Views group 
    
    View | Data | Tables | Cost 
    in the Fixed Cost field enter the cost amount. In the Fixed Cost Accrual field click the accrual method

    + Scheduled summary tasks manually 
    
- Fine tune resource and assignment details 
    +  A resource’s maximum units value does not prevent a resource from becoming overallocated, but Project indicates when the resource’s assignments exceed the resource’s maximum units capacity.
    
    + Customize a resource' availability over time
