Unity 2017 2D Game Development Beginners Guide=Lauren S. Ferro;Note=Erxin

# Chapter 1 Press Start
- game design process 

concept -> design and prototyping -> implementation -> test -> publish 

- game design 

    + brainstorming designing 
    + ideas can be adventurous and completely bizarre 
    + defining demographics helps refining idea 
    + need to think about kind of environment, narrative and characters 
    
    + list all your ideas 
    + challenge yourself 
    + play games that you wouldn't normally play. play games on different platforms 
    
    + deconstruction games, identify core features, and remake them 
    + learn from games 
    + be critical be judgmental 
    
    + draw out your game 
    + get what's in your head out on paper 
    + see how the interaction flows through the game 
    + considerations that you will need to iron out 
    
    + transfer into the actual game 
    + go through various iterations 
    
    + testing 
    most important part 
    help to make sure game runs smoothly 
    raise issues relative to player engagement etc 
    
- the Unity engine 
2d uses two axis x and y 
3d uses three axis x, y, z 

2d game have perspective 

utilizes 
    + depth by using a perspective camera 
    + concept known as parallax 
    
without 3d assets within environment 

- Install unity 
    + project tab show all the current projects 
    + learn tab will display several tutorial 
    + open instruction will open the browser 
    
- Overview of Built-In features in Unity 
    + Creating new 2d project 
    + new interface 
    
- Game object
    + prop or character to the scenery 
    + like containers 
    + place things into component 
    lighting, animation, character control, rendering, physics, and colliders 
    + gives game object functionality 
    
    

# Chapter 2 Working with assets 
- Textures and sprites 
    + sprites 
    image can be used as 2d object 
    two coordinates 
    repositioned, scaled and rotated 
    move, destory, create 
    
    rendered directly against the camera 
    change this using sprite renderer in 3d 
    work with sprite renderer, 3d sprite work with mesh renderer 
    
    + Textures 
    used to change appearance of an object 
    are not objects 
    cannot get them to move during gameplay 
    create images with sprite sheets/atlases 
    
    + difference 
    sprite sheet has sprite animations 
    
    altas contain image such as tileable textures 
    
    + purpose 
    maximize the space 
    
    combining multiple images into one texture 
    
- sprite renderer 
displays images that have been imported as type sprite 

number of different parameters that allow you modify sprite 
    + color 
    + parameters 
    + flip 
    + order in layer 
    + sorting layers 
    + material which is used by unity to render the sprite 

- sprite editor 
used to edit sprites 
selecting them individually from a larger image 

    + text may have multiple graphic elements 
    + extract elements from single texture by using the sprite editor 
    + take multiple elements from an atlas or sprite sheet 
    + slice them into individual sprites 
- sprite packer 
increase the efficiency of your project's usage of main memory 

achieves by packing various sprites into a single place 
- sprite creator 
create a sprite holder 

- set up first game, setting up sprites 
    + using sprite editor 
    + sprite packer 
    + sprite creator 
    
    + drag and drop images into project pannel 
    in the right corner inspector panel change the texture type to sprite 2d and ui 
    
    sprite mode to to Multiple 
    
    click the sprite editor button on the inspector pannel 
    
    now we can select the elements in the sprite and create name for each of the elements 
    
    there is a slice menu on top of the sprite editor. 
    type 
        * automatic
        * grid by cell size 
        * grid by cell count 
        
    method means how the created sprites will be created, 
    
- enable sprite packer, Edit|Project Settings|Editor. look the inspector select the sprite packer type 
Mode, always enabled will boost the performance of your game 

Window|Sprite packer. 

- what if you don't have sprites? 
add palceholders or images 
useful thing to use them you're prototyping an idea 
using sprite creator 
    + Asset|Create|Sprites will created sprite placeholder. The texture is used png and have a default name. you can rename the name 
    
- setting up the angel cakes project
