-  Settings > Network & Internet > Airplane Mode.) The third button, available on any device with a Wi-Fi adapter, activates the system as a mobile hotspot. 

You can read about Microsoft’s IPv6 efforts at https://bit.ly/ms-ipv6. Almost all of Google’s services now work over IPv4 and IPv6, as does Yahoo. Facebook’s giant data centers now run IPv6 exclusively, and Netflix has supported IPv6 for years.

- Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA). When no DHCP server is available, Windows automatically assigns an IP address in a specific private IP range.

- Alternate IP Configuration. Use this feature to specify multiple IPv4 addresses for a single network connection 

-  Network Address Translation (NAT) to pass packets back and forth between the single public IP address and the multiple private IP addresses on the network.

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has reserved the following three blocks of the IPv4 address space for use on private networks that are not directly connected to the internet:
10.0.0.0–10.255.255.255
172.16.0.0–172.31.255.255
192.168.0.0–192.168.255.255


# Windows networking 
- mobile hotpot 
- PowerShell commands Get-NetConnectionProfile and Set-NetConnectionProfile, which are documented at https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/netconnection.

- network type 

    + Public. This is the default setting for any new, untrusted network connection. Network discovery is turned off for public networks

    + Private. This option is appropriate when you’re connecting to a trusted network, such as your own network at home

    Windows enables network discovery for sharing with other users on the network.

    + Domain. This option is applied automatically when you sign in to Windows using a computer that’s joined to a Windows domain, such as your company network. 
    
    allowing you to see other computers and servers on the network by using accounts and permissions controlled by a network administrator

- a workgroup or a domain

In a workgroup, the security database for each computer (including, most significantly, the list of user accounts and the privileges granted to each one) resides on that computer. When you sign in to a computer in a workgroup, Windows checks its local security database to see whether you provided a user name and password that matches one in the database. All computers in a workgroup must be on the same subnet. A workgroup is sometimes called a peer-to-peer network.

a domain consists of computers that share a security infrastructure, Active Directory, which in turn is managed on one or more domain controllers running Windows Server. 
Windows authenticates your credentials against the security database defined by your network administrator.

- wireless network standards 
802.11g. This standard was current up until 2009, maximum rate of 54 megabits per second using radio frequencies in the 2.4-GHz range.

802.11n. Using this standard, adopted in 2009, you can expect to see dramatic improvements in speed (600 megabits per second) as well as significantly greater range. 

802.11ac. Also known as Wi-Fi 5, this standard was finalized in 2014 and builds on the 802.11n specification. 

802.11ac. Also known as Wi-Fi 5, this standard was finalized in 2014 and builds on the 802.11n specification. It allows multiple links at both ends of the wireless connection

802.11ax. As of late 2018, this standard had not yet been finalized. It promises greater efficiency and theoretical maximum speeds of 11 gigabits per second.

- wireless encrypt standard 

Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2). Based on the 802.11i standard, WPA2 provides the strongest protection for consumer-grade wireless networks. It uses 802.1x-based authentication and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption; combined, these technologies ensure that only authorized users can access the network and that any intercepted data cannot be deciphered. 

WPA2-Enterprise requires a server to verify network users. All wireless products sold since early 2006 must support WPA2 to bear the Wi-Fi CERTIFIED label.

Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). WPA is an earlier version of the encryption scheme that has since been replaced by WPA2.

Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP). WEP is a first-generation scheme that dates back before the turn of the century. 

- security at the access point 
Change the network name (SSID) of your access point to one that doesn’t match the hardware defaults

Disable remote administration of the access point

Whether you decide to allow remote administration of the access point or not

Check the firmware and drivers for wireless hardware 

Consider using a virtual private network (VPN) for wireless connections.

Hotspot 2.0 (which also goes by the names HS2 and Wi-Fi Certified Passport) is designed to make Wi-Fi connection effortless and secure. Based on the 802.11u Wi-Fi standard, all Hotspot 2.0 networks use WPA2-Enterprise security.

# Hardware and devices 
- Drivers are compact control programs that hook directly into Windows and handle the essential tasks of communicating your instructions to a hardware device and then relaying data back to you. 

- This core library is copied during Windows setup to a protected system folder, %SystemRoot%\System32\DriverStore. (Driver files and associated elements are stored in the FileRepository subfolder.) 

As an administrator, you can add signed third-party drivers to the driver store by running an installer program. 

All devices with drivers in the DriverStore folder include Setup Information files in the %SystemRoot%\Inf folder.

Windows completes the installation of a driver package, it performs all the tasks specified by the Setup Information file(.inf) and copies the driver files themselves to %SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers.

- Device Manager (Devmgmt.msc) is to right-click the Start button (or press Windows key+X) and then click the Device Manager

A mounted drive is a volume that is mapped to an empty folder

The two principal types of hard-disk organization in Windows are called basic and dynamic, dynamic disks can contain spanned or striped volumes
    + A simple volume is a volume contained entirely within a single physical device. On a basic disk, a simple volume is also known as a partition.
    
    + A spanned volume is a volume that combines space from physically separate disks
    
    + A striped volume is a volume in which data is stored in 64-KB strips across physically separate disks to improve performance.
    
    + Active partition, boot partition, and system partition. The active partition is the one from which an x86-based computer starts after you power it up. The first physical hard disk attached to the system (Disk 0) must include an active partition.

- MBR (master boot record) and GPT (GUID Partition Table) are terms describing alternative methods for maintaining that information that defines a disk’s subdivisions

The primary purpose of the tool is to facilitate the conversion of systems running in legacy BIOS mode to UEFI. (You can’t use this tool on a non-system disk.) you can also run it from the Windows 10 command line, using the /AllowFullOS switch. It completes its task without deleting data on the target disk.

Windows 10 includes a utility called MBR2GPT that provides a way past this limitation. GPT is required on drives that contain the Windows partition on UEFI-based systems.

- FAT (File Allocation Table), NTFS, exFAT (Extended File Allocation Table); optimized for use with flash drives), CDFS (Compact Disc File System; also sometimes identified as ISO-9660), and UDF (Universal Disk Format). Windows 10 provides read/write ability for the Resilient File System (ReFS)

- NTFS 

Reliability. Because NTFS is a journaling file system, an NTFS volume can recover from disk errors more readily than a FAT32 volume.

Security. On an NTFS volume, you can restrict access to files and folders by using permissions. (For information about using NTFS permissions

Expandability. Using NTFS-formatted volumes, you can expand storage on existing volumes without having to back up, repartition, reformat, and restore.

Efficiency. On partitions greater than 8 GB, NTFS volumes manage space more efficiently than FAT32. The maximum partition size for a FAT32 drive created by Windows 10 is 32 GB

Optimized storage of small files. Files on the order of a hundred bytes or less can be stored entirely within the Master File Table (MFT) record

Exfat VS. Fat32Microsoft introduced the Extended FAT (exFAT) file system first with Windows Embedded CE 6.0, an operating system designed for industrial controllers and consumer electronics devices. 

The exFAT file system removes the 32-GB volume and 4-GB file-size limitations of FAT32. It also handles more than 1,000 files per directory.

on-PC consumer electronics devices might be able to read earlier FAT systems but not exFAT

- format does not remove a volume content

# Hyper-V
- Business editions of Windows 10—Pro, Enterprise, and Education—include a built-in hypervisor and associated management tools that are collectively part of a feature set called Hyper-V.
- official document,  “Hyper-V on Windows 10,” at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/.

- Virtual Machine Management Service (Vmms.exe) and the Hyper-V Host Computer Service (Vmmcompute.exe) both run under the credentials of the currently signed-in user; 

- Hyper-V Manager (Virtmgmt.msc) is a Microsoft Management Console snap-in that provides management access to the virtualization platform.

- Virtual Machine Connection (Vmconnect.exe) is a Windows desktop program that allows you to interact with a running virtual machine using the keyboard and mouse on the host PC. 

- check whether system support hyper-v or not. run msinfo32.exe

Scroll to the bottom of the System Summary tab to see four entries that begin with “Hyper-V,” as shown here

VM generations, including a list of supported operating systems, visit https://bit.ly/Gen1Gen2.

- networking 
in  generation 1 machines only, you can install a legacy network adapter capable of booting directly to a network and running unsupported operating systems.

    + Private. Use a private virtual switch to set up a network that comprises only the virtual machines running on your physical computer and using the same virtual switch. isolate from all physical computers 
    
    + Internal. An internal virtual switch allows connections among virtual machines on the host PC using the same virtual switch; those VMs can also connect to the host PC

    + External. This is the correct choice for a VM that you want to use as if it were another PC on your local network


- Microsoft’s Virtualization Blog: https://bit.ly/hyperv-gallery-new-vm.

 virtual machine files at https://bit.ly/free-vms-webdev.

- a generation 2 virtual machine—a setting that cannot be changed. As described in the previous section, “What’s in a virtual machine?” a generation 2 machine is the appropriate choice when the guest operating system you plan to use is a recent 64-bit version of Windows or a recent Linux distribution.

- Using these dynamic memory settings, the VM will never have less than 4 GB of RAM available to it.

- check RAM usage by VM, open Hyper-V Manager, select the VM whose resource usage you want to check, and then click the Memory tab in the status pane below the Virtual Machines list

- Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which allows the disks in a virtual machine to be encrypted with BitLocker Disk Encryption.

- Virtual Machine Connection (VMConnect) window using one of two session types:

    + Basic sessions run in the VMConnect console window, which can be expanded to any resolution supported by the virtual display adapter

    + Enhanced sessions, which debuted with Hyper-V in Windows 8.1, provide a significantly richer experience, with the ability to share the Clipboard with the host machine, redirect audio from the VM to the host PC’s speakers or headphones

- Checkpoint. This button creates a checkpoint, which is a snapshot of the virtual machine’s state and its data.

- Share. Use this option, introduced in version 1709, to export the entire virtual machine configuration and data files (but not checkpoints) to a compressed file in VMCZ format. 

- Windows 10 supports the use of Hyper-V Containers, which are self-contained virtual environments that can manage workloads without requiring the overhead (and licensing cost) of a full operating system.

- Microsoft Windows Script Host (WSH) provides a way to perform more sophisticated tasks than the simple jobs that batch programs are able to handle. 

WSH has two nearly equivalent programs—Wscript.exe and Cscript.exe—that, with the help of a language interpreter dynamic-link library such as Vbscript.dll, execute scripts written in VBScript or another scripting language. (Cscript.exe is a command-line program; Wscript.exe is its graphical counterpart.)

With WSH, the files can be written in several languages, including VBScript (a scripting language similar to Microsoft Visual Basic) and JScript (a form of JavaScript). Windows 10; interpreters for Perl, KiXtart (KixKIXE), Python, RexxHex, and other languages are available elsewhere.
