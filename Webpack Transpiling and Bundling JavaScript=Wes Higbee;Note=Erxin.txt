Webpack Transpiling and Bundling JavaScript=Wes Higbee;Note=Erxin

# What is webpack 
- welcome 
    + interactive viewing 
    use vue.js 
    
    vue can not refresh browser and reflect the changes 
    
    + react could do the same 
    + angular.js will refresh the page 
    
- webpack benefits 
    + interactive coding 
    + seamless compilation 

- check module support website 
http://caniuse.com

    
- compiler hook types 
    + reference 
    https://github.com/webpack/tapable#hook-types
    
Basic hook (without “Waterfall”, “Bail” or “Loop” in its name). This hook simply calls every function it tapped in a row.

Waterfall. A waterfall hook also calls each tapped function in a row. Unlike the basic hook, it passes a return value from each function to the next function.

Bail. A bail hook allows exiting early. When any of the tapped function returns anything, the bail hook will stop executing the remaining ones.

Loop. TODO

- benefit bundling for performance 
- sophisticated bundling, bundle per page, bundle/clode splitting, minify, lazy load, remove unsued code for different products 

$ npm install lodash 

module format interop (CJS node), ESM(harmony) AMD (RequireJS), UMD, globals 

webpack is a module loader /resolution, your responsibility is to specify relationships between modules, not path & script order 

- help with caching 
caching can be tailored to development and production separately. we require cache in product and no cache in development 

- source maps, source map file will be generated by webpack for help set breakpoint in the bundled files 

- webpack benefits 
caching 

dev isn't prod, easily customized builds per environment 

source map 

platform for transformation 

- a compiler platform 

service worker and appcache 

course series and updates 

incremental builds, even without interactive coding 

extensible via Plugins and Loaders 

use future technology 

- can import webassembly and supoprt cpp, rust with webpack 

- debugger.html, dev-tool is used webpack 

- course series and updates 
tentative course series 

    + first bundle js 
    + second bundle css, less etc with web app 
    + multiple bundles 
    + bundle optimization

# Bundling code 
- cloning and starting the solitaire

    + clone the game

    https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html
    
- bundling app.js 
$ npm install -D webpack 

$ npx webpack --help 

npx is used to run command locally which is release with npm 

$ npx webpack app/app.js app/dist/app.bundle.js 

this will only package only the entry point file

we could replace the entry file location into the html 

webpack will help us wrapper the code into a function boilerplate

we could add import JS file to let webpack package the relative JS files for us 

- webpack polyfills module for help compatible with old world browsers 
- webpack polyfills use strict
