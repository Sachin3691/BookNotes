Minix3 introduction;Note=Erxin

# top 10 features
- minimal amount of kernel codes, about 4000lines, compare to linux 2.5 million and 5 million window xp. this means less bugs, consider 1000 lines of could may contain a bug
- move the code to user space, keep mouse of the service and drivers run as user mode program may cause a little bit performance recede but greatly reduce the amount of damage a bug can do
- the driver run as user mode make it only could touch the device they really own
- the operating system is self repairing, all drivers and services are children of the reincarnation server
- interprocess communication uses synchronous rendezvous communication using fixed-length message, the message size is not a parameter of  IPC calls, this eliminate all bugs associated with buffer management as well as stack overruns caused by unexpectedly large message
- interrupts and message passing are unified in a very simple way, which make system programming much easier
- wild stores due to bad pointers in a driver cannot corrupt any memory outside the driver's own
- data space are split in minix3 and only code in (read-only) instruction space can be executed, this eliminate the damage from buffer overrun vulnerabilities that are commonly exploited by virsues and worms execute injected code is limited
- infinite loops in driver no longer hang the system
- the system could be configured to restrict drivers and servers to subset of the avaliable kernel calls

# performance
- the performance of minix3 is like the minix2 and only have a acceptable reduce in nsec

# the user view of minix3
- over 400 unix programs have been written or ported into minix such as 
    * shells, ash, bash, pdksh, rsh, zsh
    * editors, ed, ematcs, ex, nvi, vim, elvis, elle, mined, sed
    * languages, awk, C, bison, flex, perl, python, yacc, lua
    * programming tools, cdiff, make, patch, tar, touch
    * networking, ssh, pine, ftp, lynx, mail, rlogin, wget
    * file utilities, cat, cp, bzip2, compress, mv, dd, uue
    * text utitlities, grep, head, paste, prep, sort, spell, tail
    * administration, adduser, cron, fdisk, mknod, mount
    * x window
    
# other microkernels systems
- mach V
- amoeba
- perseus, DROPS, NIZZA
- QNX, GHU Hurd, Nemesis, Mungi and SawMill Linux, these don't have fail recover
