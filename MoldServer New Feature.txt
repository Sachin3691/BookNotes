:KTW mold server requirements, (HyCap 3.0)
>KTW business process
    -no connections to BAAN/PSF/etc
    -Most designer have limited access to the Husky WAN
    -Unigraphics(NX CAD) is not used
    -PSF files are not used
    -Manual data entry
    -Hot half and cold half manuafactured in different locations
    -Support future data automation similar to HyPet HPP
>supply data required by HyCap machine software
    -tag data so molds can be identified
    -no part(preform) data as SOC is not implement
>Page design, import feature block
    -Project details
    -Mold details
    -Components supply
    -In house test required
>Design Notes
    -order are entered in word doc
    -need create screen to input order, <- load order doc and automatic fill in words
    -Project Type
        new mold
        refurb/conversion
    -Project Description - user enterd
    -Customer name

        ?, How to get list from existing BAAN? does this contain all customers?
    -Mold Designs
        KTW 3.0(for HyCap standard 3.0 systems)
        KTW HPP 3.0(for HyCap hpp 3.0 systems)
    -Mold Parameters
        Pitch
        Cavitation
        >todo: Need list of acceptable pitch/cavitation
        >todo: do ktw tools have serial numbers?
        What are the pitch/cavitations for the molds?(current & planned)
            ktw 3.0
                32-cav large pitch
                ...
            ktw hpp 3.0
                32-cav large pitch
    -Q&C
        Don't need part information
        not require min/max
        cold haf and hot half are manufactured at different place
        ?,where are the tags to be programmed?
        BOM data will be located in different location
            hot runners, luxembourg, alternatively Vermont
            Molds(KTW3.0, KTW HPP3.0) Luxembourg, in the future BOM could be located at KTW(BAAN co.number:tbd)
            Machine: Husky Bolton(co.085), Husky Shanghai(co.818?)
        Factory Location
            Bolton
            Luxembourg
            Vermont(alternative to Luxembourg, but only is case of capacity constraints)
            Shanghai
            KTW Austria
        Currently there is no BAAN at Austria
        BAAN part names for the plates that need tags
            KTW 3.0:
                Hot half: manifold plate
                          cavity plate
                Cold half
                          Core backing plate
            KTW HPP 3.0:
                Hot half: manifold palte
                          cavity plate(mold)
                cold half: Ejector Box Plate, non-op side(mold)
>SOC, simplify operation control
 
:KTW Tag Programming page
same functionality as hyPet hpp
see HS 677 Mold ID Tag Memory Map.doc. Implement tag map version 3.
"http://boltfs02/sites/HmiReArchitecture/Requirements/Epics/SmartID Epics and Requirements/Tag memory/HS 677 Mold ID Tag Memory Map.doc"
    
:KTW Test/qc, cd programming page
configuration file contain only the details for the project
add project detials
customer description will be empty string
default file name is :project<projec number>mold identification.hkupdate
merging would still be done at the machine
possibly link projects via baan customer

:Question
IMPT? standard for important?
Is there a new tool will be create to abstact the data from UG for KTW? It's similar to volumetric tool.
Does KTW machine need to load the configuration file?
Does the KTW designer can't connect to husky WAN?
Where are the tags to be programmed?    
If the KTW requirement is wroten in word do we need to add a feature to load order doc and automatic fill some fields?   
The display order of BAAN shipping location customer name?
do ktw tools have serial numbers?
Do we already have the pitch/cavitations for the KTW molds?
