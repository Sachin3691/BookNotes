# Mobile Web 
- mobile browers 
    + webkit 
    + safari 
    + mobile firefox 
    + opera mobile 
    
- market 
safari mobile > opera mini > android browser > symbian ... 

- html5 in the enterprise 
- reference book mobile design pattern gallery 
- frameworks and approaches 
    + frameworks 
    jQuery mobile 
    jQTouch, http://jQTouch.com, unmantainance in recent three years 
    xui, born from phonegap framework, http://xuijs.com

# Mobile Performance techniques 
- UI handled by GPU when animations and transistions through css
- HTML5e specification 
- hardware acceleration 
- page transitions, slide, flip and rotation effects 
    + demo http://html5e.org/slide-flip-rotate.html dead link
    + html5e is a term coined in HTML5 and JavaScript Web Apps. It stands for HTML5 Enterprise and is an identifier for the 5 specifications and the 5 most widely supported browsers
    + relative books 
    + debugging hardware acceleration 
    reduce the quantity of layers 
    keep layers as small as possible 
    update layers infrequently 
    tailor layer compositing to purpose 
    trail and error, testing is important 
    
- fetching and caching 
    + fetching pre-fecthing our pages allow users to take the app offline
    + caching, next, we want a concurrent or asynchronous approach when fetching 
    + ajax and parsing the response, using innerHTML() to insert the ajax response 
    
- network type detection and handling 
    + offline access through applicationCache 
    + detects if bookmarked and offline 
    + detects when switching from offline to online and vice versa 
    + detects slow connections and fetches content based on network type 
    
- mobile debugging
    + weinre, http://phonegap.github.com/weinre/ is a debugger for web pages like firebug for firefox, dead link 
    

# html5 from the server side 
- device and feature detection, it is often implement by creating a dom element to see it behaves as expected 
detectCanvas() ? showGraph() : showTable();
function detectCanvas() {
    var canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
    return canvas.getContext ? true : false;
}

- modernizr to detect features and browser information 

- UA detection is not always dependable, why use it? 
    + you know ahead of time 
    + in combination with feature detection javascript 
    + when you don't want all javascript based feature test to be downloaded to every browser and executed when UA-sniffing based optimization are available 
    
    https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser/

- mobileEsp http://blog.mobileesp.com is an open source framework which detects the user-agent header 

- markup and resources html5boilerplate.com 

- security
- gzip 
- jawr, http://jawr.java.net, is tunable packaging solution for javascript and css 
- ziproxy, http://ziproxy.sourceforage.net/ is a forwarding non-caching compression http proxy targeted for traiffc optimization 
- javascript minification 
- jsmin, http://www.crockford.com/javascript/jsmin.html
- packer, http://dean.edwards.name/packer/
- grunt, https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/, command line build tool for javascript project. it gives you the ability to concatenate files, validate files with jshint and minify with uglifyjs 
- javascript frameworks and server 
backbone.js, uses underscoe.js heavily and gives develoeprs the options of using jquery or zepto for the core dom framework 

    + server synchronization, backbone.sync is the function that backbone calls every time it attempts to read or save a model to the server, by default it uses (jquery/zepto)

ember.js, apple use it build mobileme 

angular.js 

batman.js, created by shopify similar to knockout and angular 

knockout.js 

mapping plugin, map plain javascript object into a view model with the appropriate observables 


# Websockets 
- advantages 
no http headers 
no lag due to keep-alive issues 
low latency, better throughput and responsiveness 
eaier on mobile device batteries 

- building the stack, pusher, http://pusher.com/ starting to emerge and companies like kaazing
