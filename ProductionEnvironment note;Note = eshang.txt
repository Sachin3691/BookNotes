:Machine sub-directory
HMI	HMI components
PLC	PLC components
SHIPPED	Archived copies of shipped versions
SYS	System configuration
TEMP	Temporary files
Install.mtc	Machine Transfer Utility (MTU) Configuration file.  This file describes the environment pointers for this machine (MTU is designed to run on a virgin system without any Microsoft Access DB components present thus cannot access the machine database to determine the correct environment settings).  This file is soon to disappear and be replaced by SETENV.CFG in the SYS directory of the machine.

:Plc directory
Robot.tps	TwinCAT Program Storage for the Robot 
SN<s/n>.PRO	TwinCAT PLC Program 
SN<s/n>.WSM	TwinCAT System Manager Configuration file

:Sys directory
CHECKLST.C	A C-file that represents the machine’s option list; automatically generated from the CHECKLST.EXE utility
CHECKLST.CFG	A raw text file which describes the data on the checklist.  The file is used as a storage location for the CHECKLST utility as well as the input file for the CHECKLST database.
REV.LOG	Machine general information and revision history
SETENV.BAT	A batch file which sets the environment variables for this machine.  This file is typically used by the W95 Servers.
SETENV.CFG	This file describes the environment pointers for this machine (MTU is designed to run on a virgin system without any Microsoft Access DB components present thus cannot access the machine database to determine the correct environment settings).  This file replaces the INSTALL.MTC file found in the HMI directory of the machine.
SYSTEM.LOG	Log file detailing the access to the machine files (automatically generated)
SYSTEM.OIT	List of modules to include on the machine; automatically generated from SYSOIT.EXE which was generated from CT2EXE.EXE.
<date>.z??	Each time a machine is compiled by the W95 Servers, the current status of the SYS is zipped into a file with this name.

:Temp directory, mac\serial number\temp
CHECKLST.CTJ	Compiled CHECKLST.C
*.H	C code header files
Revision.h	C header file detailing the compiled release version of the machine
*.LST	Lists object files to link together certain modules
SYSOIT.EXE	The chart code executable; created by CT2EXE.  SYSOIT.EXE executed creates SYSTEM.OIT (and other files) in the %OISYS\SYS directory.
SYSTEM.MDB	Module listing of the SYSTEM.OIT in binary format
*.xxx	Timestamp file indicating the last time a module was compiled.

:oicCommon directory
contains common utilities for a colleciton of bases
;
Translations	Language Translation support directories
Util	Specific utilities designated only for Polaris Control machines.
Vss	Central Visual Source Safe database for production modules.  All modules always remain in a checked out state and when modules are accessed via the production utilities, the modifications are dumped into the VSS DB.
Xref	Machine and Checklist database cross reference files and each user’s centrally logged file.
*.BAT	DOS Batch file.
*.BTM	A 4DOS Batch file.  Runs exclusively on a W95 Server.
*.EXE	Executable file
MACHINE.MDB	Access Database which contains general information about each machine
CHECKLST.MDB	Access Database which contains machine configured options information

:pcbase directory
contains utilities and modules
;
MODULIB,	Module library
UTIL,	Utilities that generally point into the bases
XREF,	Database cross reference files
;
CHART – chart modules which define rules for processing a CHECKLST.C file for a product line. 
HMI – modules which apply to the HMI.
PLC – modules which apply to the PLC.
ELEC – modules which apply to the Electrical Schematics.
HYD – modules which apply to the Hydraulic Schematics.
 The advantages to having the main base broken down by discipline include
Naming convention of modules in one discipline is not affected by another discipline.
Less modules in a single directory.
The disadvantages to having the main broken down by discipline include
System does not support a %SUBBASE variable.  The extent of which to implement is currently unknown.
Not as difficult to switch a particular discipline to a new base (i.e. HMI2).  This of course will result in too many files on a single volume.
;
MODXREF.MDB	Access Database which contains a cross reference of the machines and the modules which they use.
CHARTS.MDB	Access Database which contains a cross reference of the Chart modules and their versions 
;
CTLIB	Common routines used by all product lines.  A machine can only have one CTLIB module.
CTSTD	Module selection rules for a specific product line.  A machine can only have one CTSTD module.
CTSP1	Module selection rules to include a special (used to define machine specials).  A machine will have a CTSP1 module for each special required.
CTDV	Module selection rules to deviate from the standard (generally used for testing new modules). A machine will have a CTDV module for each deviation required.

:System specification
>Create a new machine
press the button on Production utility. This launches a selectChecklist utility that prompts the user to select a specific product line. This determines which CTSTD module to use and launches the appropiate CHECKLIST utility from the CTSTD module
The CHECKLIST utility prompts the user to enter the machine specific data and outputs a machine ooptions configuration file to the sys directory of the target machine
