pluralsi training video Entity framework, Julie Lerman

Create asp.net entity framework modle

can watch the mapping detail

reference the modle by other project need 3 step.
1. reference the modle
2. reference the system.data. entity
3. add the connection string to the current project's app.config file.

When use the entity modle to generate database. The database should be already exist in the sql server. The database could be empty.
The entity framework use medadata to record the mapping between the mold and the database.

in the solution screen. Right click the modle file and select the oepn with XML editor.
SSDL section discrib the database.
The T sequal generate the DDL

In on Entity modle will generate a class nameEntity which is inherit from the Object Context. It's use for keep the relationship between the database modle and the class.

LINQ to Entities
var context = new clsEntityModel.funEntitiyCreater();
var query = from a in context.entityModel select c;
var customers = query.tolist();

we could use mapping stored procedures instead of use the original delete, update , insert function. When use mapping stored procedure we could setup it in the entity model. 
warning:
	if only mapping one of the three function but call others will trigger exception.

Use T4 to generate entity class model and also can use it to control the generate code.
