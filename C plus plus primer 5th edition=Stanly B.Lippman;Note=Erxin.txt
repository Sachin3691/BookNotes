# Gettting started
- writing a simple c++ program
int main()
{
    return 0;
}
- if you are a beginner, the most friendly start point is command-line, then the IDE
- c++ suffix conventions, .cc, .cxx, .cpp, .cp, and .c
- check status of system
    + unix
    $ echo $?
    + windows
    $ echo %errorlevel%
- window compile command
    + cl, for visual studio
    + for visual studio 2010 
    cl /EHsc *.cpp
    /Ehsc is the option that turn on standard exception handling
- input/output, iostream library, fundamental to iostream are two types istream and ostream. The term stream in intended to suggest that the characters are generated or consumed sequentially over time
    + cin, istream object
    + cout, ostream object
    + cerr, ostream object
    + clog, ostream object
    + example
    #include <iostream>

    int main()
    {
        std::cout << "hello world" << std::endl;
    }
- all the names defined by standard library are in the std namespace
- comment, //, /* */
- flow of control
    + while statement
    while(expression){}
    + for statement
    for(init_exp;bool_exp;step_exp){}
    + example read unknown number input values
    while(std::cin >> value)
    {
        sum+= value;
    }
- end of file from the keyboard, different operating systems use different conventions 
    + window we enter an end-of-file by control+z
    + mac and unix used control+d
