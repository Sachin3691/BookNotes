    creating term vocabularies 
    enabling taxonomy with term reference fields 
    using per-defined vocabulary 
    
- what is a term vocabulary 
    + taxonomy module enabled by default 
    taxonomy using terms to classify content 
    + content can be organized through tagging 
    vocabulary a set of terms 
    ter reference field, expose term vocabularies
    
    + drupal 7 creates summary page of all nodes sharing a given term 
    
    + choose to add a vocabulary on a taxonomy page 
    
    + provide a name and description to the new create taxonomy
    
    + terms are configured with 
    name 
    description 
    parent terms, used in defining hierarchical vocabularies, such as display menu system 
    weight, control term display order(alphabetical by default)
    url alias automatic if using pathauto module 
    
    + two taxonomic approaches
    closed, control available terms to simplify searching and summarization 
    open, allow users to add new terms(folksonomy)
    
    + vocabularies can be extended at any time 
    
    + user can add terms if term reference field widget allows 
    
    + create a new term vocabulary 
        * Structure|Taxonomy add a vocabulary, the Tags vocabulary is created by drupal 
        * select a vocabulary and add new term 
        
- term-reference-fields 
    + during the add field tab 
    + select term reference field type 
    + select the vocabularies type for the term reference type

        * add field 
        * select term reference 
        * choose vocabularies 
        
    with pathauto module the new added pages could be displayed with human readable vocabulary name instead of just numbers 
    
- auto complete widget 
    + autocomplete term widget(tagging) enables adding new terms 
    + during add new field as vocabularies reference, select the widget type to autocomplete will support add new terms 
    
- summary 
taxonomy means classifying content by one or more terms 
vocabulary is an open ended list of terms 
terms can be pre-defineid for a vocabulary 
term reference fields enable adding vocabulary term to a node 
terms exposed by check box radio select, or autocomplete widgets 
new terms can be added using the autocomplete widget 
all nodes sharing a term are available from a common url 
    
# Customizing content and editing layout 
- field-sequence 
    + learn to customize display and editing layout 
    + control field sequence in editing and display 
    + using the display suite module to control field selection and layout 
    
    + manage fields field sequence determines order on edit forms, match the sequence on edit form 
    + manage display field sequence determines order for each view mode, check the Manage Display tab

- display-suite 
    + various drupal 7 modeuls can be enabled for greater layout control 
    display suite, create custom view mode and edit form layouts 
    http://drupal.org/project/ds 
    
    panels, create reusable layout 
    http://drupal.org/project/panels 
    
    context, create conditional layouts and behaviors 
    http://drupal.org/project/context 
    
    + open source projects may be have some overlap features in the modules 
    + complementary and overlapping functionality 
    + each provides an approach to solving common concerns 
    which fields to display when viewing and/or editing a node 
    how to arrange these fields 
    
    + display suite UI module enables view mode layouts, could make the teaser view layout with multiple columns 
    
    + display suite forms module, enable form layouts for the manage fields tab 
    
    + download display suit and download the recommended 
    it will be installed and could be check at Modules|Display suite, enable the display suite UI module and display suite forms modules 
    
    go to the manage display could specify columns 
    
    click title could change the field to link 
    
    the image field could change to use thumbnail display 
    
- summary 
an edit form is present when creating or modifying a content node 
view mode specifies fields for particular use, some visual some not 
visual, default teaser full content, etc 
non-visual rss search index search result 

mange fields tab controls edit form fields sequence 
mange display tab, field sequence control view model field sequence 
field types support additional configuration, link trim length, etc 
layout may be customize using the display suite, panels, content and other modules 
drupal modules are open source may have overlapping functions 


# Developing custom views
