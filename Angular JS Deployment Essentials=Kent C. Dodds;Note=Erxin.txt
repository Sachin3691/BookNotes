browser devTools 
PaaS, is shorthand for platform as a service 

# chapter 1 our app and tool stack 
- tools

:value 
:constant 
:decorator 
:view 

- install Yo
$ npm install -g yo 

- grunt is a task runner that enhances your existing and/or Yeoman's workflow by automating repetitive tasks 

after generate a new project with yo, it creates a /Gruntfile.js. it is used to performing the following tasks 

    + defines the yo places bower packages 
    + defines the path where the grunt build command places the production-ready code 
    + initialize the watch task to run 
    + JSHint when javascript are saved 
    + Karma's test runner when js file are saved 
    + compass the scss or sass files are saved 
    + saved /gruntfile.js

    + configures the grunt server command to run a node.js server on localhost:9000 or show test results on localhost:9001 
    
    + autoprefixes css rules on LiveReload and grunt build 
    + it renames files for optimizing browser caching 
    + cofgiures the grunt build command to minify images, svg, html, and css files or to safely minify angular files 
    
$grunt server 
$grunt test
