Inside the C++ Object Model=Stanley B.Lippman;Note=Erxin

# Introduction 
- what is the c++ object model 
    + the direct support for object-oriented programming within the language 
    this are covered by c++ primer 
    
    + the underlying mechanism by which this support is implemented 
    this will be covered 
    
- the first aspect of the c++ object model is invariant, virtual functions available to a class is fixed at compile time 

virtual function calls generallyresolved through an indexing into a table holding the address of the virtual functions
