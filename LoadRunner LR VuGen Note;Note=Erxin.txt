# Vusers 
- VuGen records Vuser script on windows platform only, the generated script works on both windows and linux platforms 
- you can also program Vuser script by add visual studio IDE plugin 
- Vuser types 
    + protocol based Vusers, you can create a script with single or mutiple protocol 
    + unit test based Vusers, support unit tests in the form of .dll or .jar/.class files which is created in visual studio or eclipse, check the additional components in the loadrunner dvd 
    + GUI Vusers, loadrunner can integrate functional testing scripts in the form of GUI test in to a scenario, with ctrix you can run multiple GUI Vusers 
    
    
# VuGen workflow 
- create 
    + Vuser script template 
    + work with .zip script 
    File|Manage zip files -> edit script in zip file 
    + stored in application lifecycle management 
    + application lifecycle management (ALM) to store and retrieve Vuser scripts, scenarios and analysis results 
- record, each Vuser script contain at least three sections 
    + vuser_init,
    + action,
    + vuser_end
- correlate, is used when a recorded script includes a dynamic value, such as session id 
    + correlation tab [design studio] overview 
    + prerequest, using one of the following protocols 
    web http/html 
    flex 
    rtmp/rtmpt 
    citrix 
    sap-web 
    oracle nca 
    
    + verify that record -> recording options -> correlations -> configuration 
    
    + use the correlation tab 
        * click design studio 
        * clicking the correlation button 
        * select which variable by highlighting the value in the grid and clicking the correlate button 
        VuGen add
- replaying 
    + bookmark, ctrl+F2, VuGen places a bookmark icon in the left margin of the script
        * navigate between bookmark 
        View->Bookmarks -> next bookmark or press f2, previous or press shift+f2 
        
    + run a Vuser script from a command prompt check General|Additional Attributes 
    <installation_dir>/bin/mdrv.exe -usr <script_name> 
    
    run mdrv without parameter will display the whole option lists 
    
        * the number of times to run the script as indicated by the following example:
        script1  -host pc4  -loop 5 
        
        * Specify a location for the output files.
        -out c:\tmp\vuser 
        
        * specify arguments to pass to your script by using 
        script_name -arg_name arg_value -arg_name arg_value ...
        
        * get command line arguments by lr_get_attrib_double

    + run a Vuser script from a linux command line 
        * check the Vuser setup on the linux machine by using verify_generator
        verify_generator
        
        * use shell script 
        $ run_db_vuser.sh <commands> script_name.usr

- run logic limitations 
    + trueClient predefined actions "init" and "end" are in VuGen as "vuser_init" and "vuser_end"
    + you cannot create actions with names "vuser_init", "vuser_end" or "scrip_view"
    recommend to change run logic using run logic tab when truClient browser open 
    use setting|run logic when browser not opened 
    
    + "script-view" is not a valid action, it is not added in truClient browser 
    + the run section cannot be set to random mode in the truClient browser 

- script level
    + truClient removes steps it deems to be unnecessary and places them in higher script level , the default view display level 1 steps only 
    + if the step is part of a group step, both the group step and the individual step must be modified 
    
- use alternative steps, for the condition when you want to click a option in a list box base on some text, but the text is dynamically changed base on some variable, then use the alternative step to use the original list item value will ignore the changed text 
the alternative step is located on the top of each step title position 

- modify the object identification method, in the object section of each steps 
    
- insert wait step

# Advanced topics 
- create a pcap fie, Pcap (Packet Capture) files consist of network packet data, created by capturing live network activity through capture tools such as Wireshark.
    * use tPacketCapture on Android devices 
    * capture on linux redhat, copy the linuxRH3 folder from loadrunner DVD\Additional Components\mobileRemoteAgent
    give execute permission 
    $ chmod +x mongoose
    $ chmod +x cgi-bin/mobileCGI.cgi

    * change directory to cgi-bin and run 
    export SCRIPT_FILENAME=<Full path of mobileCGI.cgi>, where <Full path of mobileCGI.cgi> is the path to the mobileCGI.cgi file
    export QUERY_STRING=STARTRECORD=0, where 0 is the 0-based sequence number of the network interface in VuGen's Start Recording dialog box
    ./mobileCGI.cgi This generates a currentPCAP.pcap file which contains all traffic captured over the specified Ethernet interface.
    
- manually program a script from within VuGen 
    + develop a Vuser script through programming within the Visual C and Visual Basic environments. 
    + install the basic Visual Studio IDE add-in
    + LoadRunner internally installs the add-in the first time you choose Open in Eclipse
- Create a script in an external IDE 
- run a script on a linux machine, Users working in Linux-only environments can program Vuser scripts. Scripts can be programmed in C or C++ and they must be compiled into a dynamic library
- additional components in the DVD folder 


# Troubleshooting and limitations for VuGen 
- internet explore may prevent download necessary workflow files because enhanced security blocks certain actions (ESC)
- error messages
    * media player error by specify a none default band width 
- install and upgrading JVMs, need restart VuGen 
- workaround add "about:internet" to the trusted sites in IE
