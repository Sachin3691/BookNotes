:installation
>electrical, 24v, shielded connecting cable has to be connected only on the prometer's side.
>cable color
white, 24v
brown, 0v power supply
green, +Ioutp, analog output
yellow,-Ioutp, analog output
grey, switches on and off led targeting light, bridge to +24v
blue violet, switch contact(reference point 0v)
black, b1
red/blue, a2
gray/pink b2
orange, screen only for cable extension, don't connect at the switchboard
>pyrometer is operated in half-duplex mode
>the baud rate is depending on the length of the communication cable
>in the case of a slow rs485 connection, it is possible that the connection will not be fast enough to recieve the pyrometer's answer to an instruction of the master. a wait time can be set to slow down the data transfer, waittime = setnumber / current_baud_rate
>connect with pc, if the pc is not available, make sure use the fast enough use or rs232 to 485 converter
>The max load resistance is 500 Ω
>Setting/Parameter Descriptions
	- factory setting
	temperature display, °C
	emissivity = 100%
	transmittance = 100%
	exposure time, min
	clear time, off
	max/min = maximum value storage preset
	analog output, 0...20ma
	led target light = active at power on
	sub range same as basic temperature range
	ambient temperature compensation = auto
	address = 00
	limit swith = off
	baud rate = 19200bd
	- parameters explain
	basic range, total temperature range
	material, store the name of different material
	change the emissivity by the table on page 14
	maxmum value storage could be set to clear by other software in this case the value type is single. the normal type is double
	address, is the rs485 connection address, 98 is the global address for third party software for connect all the pyrometers at the same time. address 99 is use to p2p connection without address asignment.
	- wait time?!, how to set and changed this!!!!
		via the "test" field of the infraWin software
		set wait time, tw=00...99

:software, infraWin
>use the software
	- select the searial port
	- number of devices
	- basic setting
		* test button use to open the test window for send command and recieve the response, ex, 'ms' is the reading temperature
	- measurement color bar
	could change the emissivity and use the autoFind button
>Listing all the record data
>trend out put
>pc sampling rate(time interval between two measurements)
>Troubleshooting
	- temperature indication too low
		* incorrect alignment
		* measuring object smaller than spot size
		* measuring object is not always in the spot size
		* emissivity set too high
		* lens contaminated
	- too high
		* emissivity set to low
		* effective by other hot machine parts
	- measuring errors
		* contamination lens
		* air contamination
		* hf-interference, check the connection of the cable
		* wrong pyrometer type
>data format, data exchange occurs in ascii format with
	- format, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, even parity(8,1,e)
	- device response to the entry of a command with: output + cr(carriage return, ascii 13), to pure entry commands with "ok" + cr
	- every command starts with 2-digit device address AA. this is followed by 2 small command letters, finish with cr
	- this is followed, if necessary for that command, by ascii 'x' parameter. if the parameter 'x' is omitted, then the device resets with the current parameter.
	- a '?' after the small command letters answers with the respective settings

:Additional instruction for the rs485 interface
>requirments to half-duplex operation, master
	- after an inquery, the bus should be switched into a transmission time of 3 bits
	- the pyrometer's response will follow after 5ms at the latest
	- if there is no response then there is a error
