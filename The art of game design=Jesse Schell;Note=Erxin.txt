The art of game design=Jesse Schell;Note=Erxin

# In the beginning 
-  What is game design
- Relationship between architects and carpenters, an architect does not need to know everything the carpenter knows, but an architect must know everything the carpenter is capable of 

- difference between game design and story decisions,  Story decisions are one aspect of a game design, but there are many, many others. Decisions about rules, look and feel, timing, pacing, risk-taking, rewards, punishments, and everything else the player experiences is the responsibility of the game designer.

- a free smartphone app, and can also be purchased as a physical deck of cards at http://artofgamedesign.com, to make it easy to use the lenses while you are designing.

- The classic games have the added advantage that they have withstood the tests of time. Their success is not due to the novelty of their technology, which is the case with many modern games.

# Experience takes place in a venue 
- platform 
- private venues 
The hearth
The workbench, a kind of private place set for working on hard problem 
The reading nook

- Public venues 
The theater
The arena, lots of games takes place in arena 
The Museum, 

- Half private/half public venues 
The gaming table 
The playground 
Anywhere 

- Venues mixed and matched, games and technologies change constantly, venues change very little. To that end, here is a lens to help you see the truth

What type of venue best suits the game I'm trying to create?

Does my venue have special properties that will influence my game?

What elements of my game are in harmony with my venue? What elements are not?



# The experience rises out of a game 
- A game’s success hinges on the players’ willingness to pretend it is important. To use this lens, think about your players’ feelings about items, objects, and scoring in your game. Ask yourself these questions:

What is valuable to the players in my game?

How can I make it more valuable to them?

What is the relationship between value in the game and the players’ motivations?

- a rant about definitions 
a game is something you play 
a toy is something you play with 
a toy is an object you play with 
fun is pleasure with surprises 

    + surprise is so basic that we can easily forget about it 
    
    story?
    game rules?
    artwork? 
    technology?
    
    + do your rules give players ways to surprise each other? 
    + do your rules give players ways to surprise themselves?
    
    Surprise is a crucial part of all entertainment—it is at the root of humor, strategy, and problem solving. 
    
- The lens of fun 
    + what parts of my game are fun? why?
    + what parts need to be more fun?

- Play 
    + Play is free movement within a more rigid structure.
    + Play is the aimless expenditure of exuberant energy.
    + Play refers to those activities which are accompanied by a state of comparative pleasure, exhilaration, power, and the feeling of self-initiative.

- Work and play … become equivalent to servitude and freedom.
- Lens of Curiosity 
    + What questions does my game put into the player’s mind?
    + What am I doing to make them care about these questions?
    + What can I do to make them invent even more questions?
    
- What is a game 
Q1. Games are entered willfully.

Q2. Games have goals.

Q3. Games have conflict.

Q4. Games have rules.

Q5. Games can be won and lost.

- Bad games have little challenge or too much challenge. Good games have just the right amount.

- Lens of Endogenous value 
What is valuable to the players in my game?

How can I make it more valuable to them?

What is the relationship between value in the game and the players’ motivations?

Games can create their own internal value.

Game have challenge 

Game are interactive 

- Any game with a goal effectively has presented you with a problem to solve. Examples might be:

- problem solving, A game is a problem-solving activity, approached with a playful attitude.

What problems does my game ask the player to solve?

Are there hidden problems to solve that arise as part of gameplay?

How can my game generate new problems so that players keep coming back?

- the fruits of our labor 
Fun is pleasure with surprises.

Play is manipulation that satisfies curiosity.

A toy is an object you play with.

A good toy is an object that is fun to play with.

A game is a problem-solving activity, approached with a playful attitude.


# The Game Consists of Elements 
- Figure 
- Mechanics: These are the procedures and rules of your game. 
- Story: This is the sequence of events that unfolds in your game. 
- Aesthetics: This is how your game looks, sounds, smells, tastes, and feels. 
- Technology: We are not exclusively referring to “high technology” here,

What elements of the game make the experience enjoyable?

What elements of the game detract from the experience?

How can I change game elements to improve the experience?

- Unification 
What is my theme?

Am I using every means possible to reinforce that theme?

Having fun with your friends

Escaping from reality

Simplicity and transcendence
