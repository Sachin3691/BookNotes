# Preface 
- what is neural network 

A neural network is a mathematical function that takes in inputs and produces outputs.

A neural network is a computational graph through which multidimensional arrays flow.

A neural network is made up of layers, each of which can be thought of as having a number of “neurons.”

A neural network is a universal function approximator that can in theory represent the solution to any supervised learning problem.
