    + key performance measurements 
    + leveraging the resource monitor tool 
    + key process metrics 
    thread count 
    handle count 
    + process memory statistcs 
    + process disk & network activity 
    
- time measurements 
time unit       fraction of a second            time slices per second 
seconds 
milliseconds(ms)        1/1000 of a second  1 thousands per second 
microseconds(__mu__ s) 1/1000000 
nanoseconds(ns)         1/1000000000  light travale 1 nano seconds per foot 
cpu clock tick      100 nanoseconds             10 million ticks per seconds 

milliseconds are used to accurately measure disk and network response time 
nanoseconds are used to accurately measure RAM accesstime 

- data measurements 
memory unit             description                 approximate bytes 
bit(b)                          0 or 1 
byte(B)                       8bits = 1 byte 
kilobyte(KB)                                            ~1 thousand bytes 
Megabyte(MB)                                        ~1 million bytes
Gigabyte(GB)                                          ~1 billion bytes 
Terabyte(TB)                                          ~1 trillion bytes 

- leveraging the resource monitor tool, it's built-in to system 
    + interactive overview of system performance 
    + viewed by cpu memory disk & network activity 
    + start via task manager, server manager or resmon.exe 
    + expand categories to quickly identify top activity 
    + manage processes & services (end, suspend, restart...)
    + window 2008 r2 and later provides significant new functionality similar to process explorer(handes, registry keys, modules, ...)
    
- resource monitor 
    + oveview will list all the processes 
    + disk usage 
    + memory usage 
    
- key process metrics 
    + process count, number of processes running to the system 
    + thread count, number of threads per process or per system 
    typical desktop have 1000 thread, server may have 2000 to 5000 
    + handle count, number of objects referenced by a process 
    file 
    directory 
    registry key 
    desktop 
    section 
    event 
    semaphore 
    mutant 
    ALPC port 
    ...
    
    check if there is handle count leak 
    
- process memory statistics 
working set, application loaded into process working set. portion of memory per process can grow as additional demand. one of the key process memory metrics 

page faults, requested data is not working set 

hard faults, requests hard disk access for data 

commit, amount of virtual memory reserved 

shareable, virtual memory that can be shared 

private, process private bytes of memory 

the working set and private bytes indicate how much memory the process is using 


sign is memory leak is private bytes continue grow and not descrease 

- process disk and network activity, process i/o metrics 
read (bytes/second)
write(bytes/second)
total(bytes/second)
io opereations/seconds(IOPS)
response time or latency (milliseconds) 

in the network activity the gray out connection means the the connection is just gone away 
the disk queue lenght is greater than 1 which means the process process the i/o very hard 

deselect the process name from the filter to display all the process information in all tabs

    + additional processor if sockets are available 
    
    + upgrade processors to higher speeds & more core 
    
    + sufficient RAM is available to avoid paging swapping CPU overhead
