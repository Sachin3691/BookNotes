- What is Vuser script?
Steps, structures contain user action 
    + actions
    + function call 
    + flow control 

Actions contains a series of steps, generally corresponds to a business process of your app 

Run logic, the flow of your script, meaning the order actions run in and the number of times they run

## TruClient standard alone requirements and installation 
- System requriements 
- Standalone installer 
    + AppPulse, https://software.microfocus.com/en-us/software/customer-technical-support-services
    
    + Business Management Services, https://software.microfocus.com/en-us/software/customer-technical-support-services
    
- Standalone support convet TC2Web

## TruClient lite
- upload file path need to manually changed from mac to window vice versa 

## Script and file management 
- support zip or script 
- lite save as zip 
- certificate in lite 
To record or replay a script that uses a client-side certificate in TruClient Lite, the certificate must be installed on the system certificate repository.

When TruClient Lite for Chrome uses the certificate you installed in the system certificate repository, a dialog box asks the user to select a certificate,

To avoid display of the certificate display dialog box, after installing the certificate add a key using regedit. To HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Google\Chrome\AutoSelectCertificateForUrls, add a string value key named "1", with value “{"pattern":"*","filter":{}}”


## Performance metrics 
- The following performance metrics can be recorded 
    + end to end transaction response time, includes client time and browser rendering time 
    + web page component break down, web page and resources 
    + HAR, a standard HAR file 
    + throughput, count of bytes transferred between the browser and the server 
    + hits, count of http requests sent from the client 
    + connections, count of connections opend by the browser to server 
    
- Online and local help centers 


# Fundamentals 
## TruClient step structure 
- Step editor 
step level 
optional step, in the event that the step can not find its object, the script continues without return an error 
alternative step, indicate a step wihch can be redefined in alternative ways

- step section user interface elements 
action, the action that define the step 
object timeout, in second 
step timeout, in second 
minimum time, in second 
end event, can be automatic(not set yet, timers end), action complete, dom content loaded, step synchronous network completed, document load, object exists, step network completed, dialog opened 

- arguments section 
plain values, text 
javascript expression 
name of a parameter 

- object section user interface elements 
highlight 
replace 
roles, the functions that TruClient understands about an object, the list of avaliable action is defined by the role. read-only 
name
id method, identifying method. automatic, xpath, javascript, descriptors 
related object, in relation to an anchor object 

- xpath and javascript object id method 
    + click regenerate expression and select object to regenerate xpath 
    
    + evalXPath in js returns an array of the object defined by xpath 
    
    + you can modify the suggested xpath to return a different list 
    
    + use TruClient random function to return a random element, random(document.getElementsByTagName("myArray"))
    
- Transactions selection 
- Understand end events, the end event occurs the next step can start while the current step continues in the background. The end event for each step is set by TruClient for each browser the first time the script is replayed 

- Events in a typical step 
Step container 
                        -> step start 
                        -> action start 
    |Action             -> action completed 
                        -> DOM content loaded 
    |Additional action  -> step sync network completed 
                        -> document loaded 
                        -> step network completed 
                        -> dialog opened 
                        -> step completed 
                        -> dialog opened 
                        -> step completed 
                        -> after step ended 
                        
- end events, run times, and transaction times on different browsers 

    + if a transaction includes steps with different end events on different browsers, the transaction time may be different between browsers 
    
    + To adapt script to all browsers you may need if browser step to differentiate the end end types 

- when to manually change step end events 
    + You want to start the next step in your script once a specific object is visible on the screen 
    + end event different between browser

## Browsers in TruClient
- Replaying on all browsers, difference between browsers 
render time 
step end event 
object identification 
authentication 
differences in feature sets between browsers 

- testing on different browsers 
analysis support compare transaction response time between browsers 

- troubleshooting issues replaying a script across browsers, use if browser to handle 
end events 
object identification 
security, if authentication or a client certificate is required in only some of the browsers drag a authentication step into the if browser step 

- private browsing, not save password, cookies and history 
- TruClient browser for internet explorer 
    + The TruClient Browser for IE (Internet Explorer) simulates the functionality of an IE browser.
    
    + IE cache management, Use the IE Cache Enabler tool to implement the IE cache simulation mechanism on every Load Generator, Controller or BPM agent machine that runs TruClient IE scripts.
    
    <Installation folder\bin> run HPETruClientCacheEnabler.exe 
    
    disable/enable IE cache simulation

    + TruClient IE does not support DOMStorage and AppCache cache separation for virtual users.
    
- Firebug lite,  Advanced > Firebug Lite or by pressing F12 while in TruClient's IE browser.

- TruClient for IE can only record and replay applications in Standards Mode.

can temporarily deactivate enforcement by deselecting Advanced > Enforce Standards Mode. 

- Enable the negotiate method for authentication 
If your application server supports only the negotiate method for authentication (the HTTP response is with "HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized" and "WWW-Authenticate: Negotiate"), you must enable the negotiate option. To do so:

Open the registry setting HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Hewlett-Packard\TruClient\TruClientIE\TCWindows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings.

Change the value of the EnableNegotiate registry key from "0" to "1".

- limitation
    + If you are using Windows 10 and you launch the TruClient IE browser, the system's proxy settings are changed to the settings specified in TruClient IE 
    
    + The system proxy might be used instead of a proxy specified in the script when running more than one Vuser on a Windows 10 load generator.

# Develop scripts 
## Record a TruClient script 
- create a script 
vugen 
lite 
standalone 

- mobile web 
    + vugen > tools > mobile center device manager> add mobile device or import mobile device 
    
- configure browser setting in TruClient General Settings button 
- record a script 
    + record after 
    + record before 

- replay and save 
    
## record a truclient mobile script 


## Implement run logic 
- File > new 
- Create actions from actions tab 
- Record the business process into corresponding actions 
- Example 
login 
search flight 
select flight 
book flight 
logout 

- sequential run logic 
- random run logic 
- limitations 
    + init and end are presented in VuGen vuser_init and vuser_end 
   
    + vugen run-time settings run logic will not be displayed in the truclient browser until you close and reopen truclient 
    
    + script view is not a valid action. 
    + run section cannot be set to random mode in the truclient browser 
    
    + play from selected step will not work for a step that is located in an action that is not part of the run logic 
    
    + truclient does not support setting run properties on master run block such as iteration and run logic 
    

## Replay 
- Synchronize script steps 
    + interactive record the business process, After the interactive recording, each End Event is set to Automatic: Not Yet Set.
    
    + identify the end event 
    automatic: not set yet has not been determined 
    automatic timers ended, setTimeout or setInterval running as part of the document load in the JS 
    
    action completed 
    
    dom content loaded 
    
    step synchronize network completed, when all http requests have been completed 
    
    document load 
    
    object exits 
    
    step network completed, http request complete including XHR 
    
    dialog opened, when a dialog box is opened 
    
- confirm the end event, use if browser step 
    
    
## debug scripts 
- view replay errors in development window 
- run step by step 
- view log, VuGen > Output Pane > Browser Name- interactive replay 
- insert breakpoints 
- debug script using snapshots 
- modify and view script and step levels 
- handling short events 
- insert wait steps 
- debugging plug-ins 
- resolving step timeouts 
- general tips for successfully interactive replay 
    + do not switch between applications during interactive replay 
    + do not re-size the browser between record and replay 
    + customization for browser will not be saved between different scripts 
    + open different browser when record with lite 
    + select browser for cloud and not for lite 
    
- tips for working with large scripts 
    + divide script into multiple actions and functions, each does not have more than 50 steps 
    
    + meaningful names 
    + add comments 
    
    + avoid generating alternative steps during recording 
    + avoid generate level 2 and 3 steps 
    
    
## Snapshots 
- Configure in general settings button and select the interactive options tab 

    + during record 
    snapshots are created in memory 
    
    + stop record 
    snapshots are saved under the snapshots folder 
    
    + save script in interactive mode
    
    + during interactive replay 
    
- configure snapshot generation 
    + general setting 
    + interactive option or runtime setting 
    + record snapshot generation 
    + replay snapshot generation 
    
- view a snapshot 
    + double click a snapshot in the development window 
    + view snapshot in the truclient snapshot viewer 
    + play slide show 
    + view compare snapshot, support synchronize scrolling 
    + display the snapshots in thumbnails view 
    
- object identification
    + Suspend object selection mode (CTRL+ALT+F4)
    + Highlighting an object
    + Improve object identification, only available for automatic object selection 
    
    + Enhance end event object identification
    + Use alternative steps, Alternative steps allow you to view instances in which there are multiple ways to perform the same user action in a step
    
    could switch between these step options, •Before selecting one of the alternatives, try highlighting the object used by the alternative step and replaying it
    
    To disable this option, clear the Create alternative steps when applicable setting in Interactive Options
    + Modify the object identification method
    + Modify the script timing, insert wait step 
    + Relate an object to other objects, you can label the object based on a different, more stable object. Relations are defined visually
    
    Use the minimum search area to improve performance
    
    Each identification methods have it's own relative object 
    + Replace an object
    + Learn about the object identification assistant
    + Cannot confirm object
    + Multiple objects found
    + Object not found
    + Wrong level on step, a step in a higher level is needed for the identification of the object of current step 
    
    + Non-standard upload of files, only support for IE and Chrome 

- Troubleshooting object identification 
    + How related objects can help the XPath and JavaScript identification methods
    
    use relative object to help narrow down the objects provided by xpath 
    
    + Interactive replay fails with Object Not Found error
    
    add wait step 
    + Interactive replay fails with Object Not Found although highlight locates the object
    + Replay fails to select an item from a list
    One of the common reasons for this is that the names of the items in the list are dynamic.
    
        * Use an alternative step that selects an item from the list using the ordinal identifier instead of the text of the actual item.
        
        * •If the text is only partially dynamic you can use a regular expression to locate the required item based on partial text matching.
        
    + Enable the object identification debug log
        * Enable the Object Identification Debug log to understand why TruClient was not able to identify an object using Automatic or Descriptors ID methods
        
        create a .json file and name it additionalSettings.json in the script folder 
    
        * add content 
        {
            "TruClient": {
                "EnableIdentDescriptorsDebug": true,
                "EnableIdentDebug": true
            }
        }
    
- Descriptors, support Object Identification by specifying logical conditions for identifying the object using its HTML and CSS properties
    
- Configure descriptors manually 
    + select an object property 
    + select an operator 
    + use parameters to vary arguments 
- use a custom property or attribute 
    + The APIs to manipulate properties contain the dot operator. The attribute APIs use the “getAttribute”and “setAttribute” methods.
    
    + JavaScript properties cannot be seen in the outerHTML/innerHTML strings of an element. Attributes can be seen in those strings. 
    
    + The JSON.stringify function will serialize a subset of JavaScript properties but not DOM attributes
    
    + list of operations 
    equalsIgnoreChars 
    endsWith 
    equals 
    equalsIgnoreDigits 
    equalsIgnoreCase 
    equalsIgnoreDeviation 
    startsWith 
    contains 
    contained 
    isRegExpMatch 
    isSubstring 
    
    
## Enhance a truclient script 
- Modify steps
    + flow control steps 
    
- Insert comments
- Catch error step
    + any 
    + object identification error 
    + step arguments 
    + step action 
    
- Verify that an object exists
- Insert generic steps
    + generic object/browser action 
- Add download filters
    + can add URLs to Run-Time Settings >Download Filters to either include or exclude specific URLs while replaying your script.

## Using parameters to vary arguments 
- you create a list of values to pass. Different values are taken from the list as the load test runs. Parameters can also be used in property values of Descriptors.
    
- How to access the Parameters Dialog box in TruClient editions
    + from the vugen toolbar 
    + from the development window 

- Use a parameter as an argument value
    + select a parameter from argument option list 
    
- Convert an argument to a parameter
    + right click a value in set arguments to convert it to parameter 
- Add a parameter to your script
    + open parameter dialog to open the editor and add parameter 
- Set parameter values
- Set how and when to change parameter values during replay
    + In the Policy area of the Parameter dialog box, you can set when and how the values of each parameter are applied during the test. 
    + update rules 
    each iteration
    each occurrence 
    once 
    
    + select next row controls how to choose the next parameter 
    sequential 
    random 
    unique 
    

## Insert transactions 
- A transaction measures the time between two points in a business process. 
- About using transactions 
    + Add transactions so that you can analyze the time spent in different sections of the process after running the test.
    
    + Transactions for steps are not sequential. You can use the same transaction name in different sections of the script to join the times of actions that are not one after another.
    
- User interface of transaction editor 
    + start end point 
    step started 
    action started 
    action completed
    step synchronous network complete 
    document loaded 
    dialog opened 
    step completed only trigger when the step is successful 
    after step ended 
  
  
## TruClient functions and function libraries 
- Functions overview, a group of steps to perform a task 
- Create a function library and function from the TruClient Development Window. local or global 

- Use a reference to a function argument within the function. 

To access the function arguments within the function, use the syntax FuncArgs.<arg_name>. 


- Create a function within a script, Group Into > New Function which opens the Create New Function dialog box. 
- Create a global library, export the function library to a location on your file directory as an xml file

- Copying a test object between object repositories, However, if you copy steps containing test objects between object repositories, you create new, independent test objects that point to the same UI element. These copies are not linked to each other. To keep these objects pointing to the same UI element

- Use a function in the script, 
1.Click the TruClient Toolbox.
2.In the Functions tab, drag and drop Call Function to the correct location in your script.
3.Click the Call Function link to expand the function.
4.Specify the library and the function in the step section.
5.Specify the arguments' values in the augments section. For details, see Create a function within a script . (Optional)

- Create New Function dialog box

    
## Event handlers 
- Overview 
    + use event handlers to help your test recover smoothly from behavior of the application that either 
    
    does not occur in every run. during logon, the user sometimes get a notification. "server is busy, please wait for 10 seconds and try again"
    
    occurs at unpredicatable times. the application displays a survey popup at random times 
    
    if you record or add a step to handle such beahvior, your script may fail when the behavior does not occur 
    
    you can create a event handler for helping handle this 
    
        * object event, when an object related event occurs 
        * dialog event, used when a dialog box pops up 
        
- How to create an event handler 
    + click the event handler editor button 
    + add new one 
    + enter the properties of the event handler, select a funtion from the function library 

- Event handler editor 
    + add 
    + general setting 
    name 
    execute only once 
    allow other handlers to interrupt 
    event can be triggered during the entire script 
    
    + choose a object 
    + event 
    object exists 
    property exists on object 
    + handler 
    library 
    functions 
    arguments
