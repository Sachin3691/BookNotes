    + eye contact, good/avoid 
    + periodic responses 
    + clarifying questions 
    + relevant questions 
    + patience(not a contest to talk)
    
    + passive listening 
        * distractions, tv, email, smart phone 
        * looking over the shoulder
        * repeatedly asking to repeat 
        * disinterested feedback(um-hm)
        * wrong answers or poor questions 
        * anxious to interrupt
        
    + can you teach someone else? 
        * whether you can or not ... 
        involve in the conversation 
        
        * if you listen well, you shold be able to teach others 
        
        * ask a participant what the most important things were from a meeting 
- what is active listening 
- midset can you teach someone else 
- body language 
    + watch their mannerisms 
    + what do they do with their hands(excitement level)
    + where are they looking(deception, lack of clarity)
    + how are their arms(crossed can mean being closed), can't draw conclusion by only one indicator
    + and what is your body language 
- eye contact, with the others
    + that is a generalization
    + don't drill a hole through them with your eyes like interrogated
    + involve in the conversation 
        * not creepy 
        * not too much 5-7s 
        * definitely not too little 
        * don't follow distractions(other people, any part of their clothes, body, tv, your watch or phone etc)
- their tone 
    + where are they emotionally(stressed, excited, bored, etc)?
    + do they believe what they are saying ?
    + is there a sense of urgency?
    + will you need to resolve this immediately 
    
- responding during the conversation 
    + well-teimed, appropriate, interested "m-hm"
    + nodding or shaking your head 
    + mirror their emotions and body language 
    + ask clarifying questions 
    + respond to (even acknowledge!) their response 
    + sum up: "let me see if i understand you correctly"
    do you mean to say ...
    are you saying that 
    
    this will help both of you understand their taking better 
- taking notes 
    + don't let your note taking become a distraction 
    + notes on the phone might say "i'm on facebook, too", say I will take some note on my phone 
    + jot down the main points of the conversation 
    + a-ah moment of the conversation triggered 
    + writing down everything might mean you miss part of the conversation 
    + create special annotation for follow-up, action items 
    + write more details once the conversation is over 
- your personal debrief  
    + summary of conversation 
    + what did you learn? 
    + what did you think about the conversation and information 
    + how would you do things differently 
    + what do you need to follow-up on?
- biting your tongue 
    + some time you have to not talking, it is not race 
    + interrupting is a big sign of "i don't care ... let me talk "
    + be prepared so you can focus more on their message and response appropriately 
    + know what your main objectives are 
    + are some of your talking points tangents or distractions to your main objectives?
    + avoid the temptation to respond 
    + be ready to not get all of your point across 
    + email the points later 
    + save them for a later conversation 
    + he who talks first, loses 
    
- the power of follow-up 
    + follow-up can.. 
    show your interest level in the topic 
    show your level of commitment on the project 
    build more trust in the relationship 
    show they can trust you with more ( work, info, )
    a quick simple email
        * hi jim, thanks for the conversation I appreciated your ideas and I will get it back soon
