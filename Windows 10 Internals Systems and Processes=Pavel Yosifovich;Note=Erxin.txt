# introduction overview 
- agenda 
    + course overview 
    + windows convergence 
    + windows versions 
    + review, processes, memory and threads 
    + tools 
    + resources 
    + summary 
    
- overview 
    + objectives 
    learn about new windows 10 internals features 
    some come from windows 8.x as well 
    
    + target audience 
    developers, power QA and IT 
    pre-requisites 
    windows internals series of courses on pluralsight or equivalent knowledge 
    specially system architecture, process, threads, virtual memory 

- windows convergence into one kernel 
- windows numeric versions 
nt 4(4.0)
2000 (nt 5.0)
xp (nt 5.1)
server 2003, 2003 r2(nt 5.2)
vista, server 2008 (nt 6.0)
    version.major >= 5 && version.minor >= 1 for check xp in developer code. will cause a bug 
    this is a common case of vista bug 
    
windows 7, server 2008 r2 (6.1)
windows 8, server 2012 r2(6.2)
windows 8.1, server 2012 r2(6.3), by default, reported as 6.2
windows 10, server 2016(nt 10.0) by default, reported as 6.2
    by call GetWindowVerEx 
    
    + demo get window version in c# 
    Environment.OSVersion.Version 
    
    + add application manifest file 
    
    there is <!--windows 10--> version is commented. 
    
- windows 10 versions 

version                     build        
windows 10 rtm              10240

windows 10 version 1703     15063

- review process    
    + process       
    management and containment object 
    
    + owns 
    private address 
    private handle table to kernel objects 
    one or more threads 
    
- virtual memory 
virtual memory is continual and physical memory is not. page file trigger the page fault will let the system load the data from disk into memory 

virtual memory use same physical memory to share data, or dll 

per-process virtual address space are different between each other 

system virtual address space, singleton where kernel or device driver live 

- threads 
    + thread entity scheduled by the kernel to execute code 
    + important attributes 
    the state of CPU registers 
    current access mode(user mode or kernel mode)
    + stack 
    + priority (1-31) used in thread scheduling 

    + review threads 
    entity scheduled by the kernel to execute code 
    
        * important attributes 
        the state of CPU registers 
        current access mode(user mode or kernel mode)
        stack 
        priority (1-31), used in thread scheduling 
        state, running, ready, waiting 

- tools 
    + windows built in tools 
    task manager 
    performance monitor 
    
    + sysinternals tools(www.sysinternals.com)
    process explorer, process monitor...
    windbg, install from the windows sdk or wdk 
    
- resources books 
    + windows internals courses on pluralsight 
    + windows internals 6th edition parts 1 & 2 
    + windows internal 7th edition part 1
    + windows sysinternals administrator's reference
